# Forked Replay Harness — Progress

End-to-end test harness that forks Gnosis at a past block, replays a futarchy
proposal lifecycle with synthetic users, and asserts cross-layer agreement
(chain ↔ indexer ↔ api ↔ frontend) at every block.

The harness spans both `futarchy-fi/futarchy-api` and `futarchy-fi/interface`.
This file is mirrored across both repos. UI infra (Playwright fixtures,
page-object models, wallet stubs) is hosted here; server-side infra (anvil,
indexer, api) lives in `futarchy-api/auto-qa/harness/`.

| Branch | `auto-qa` (both repos) |
| Location | `auto-qa/harness/` in both `interface` and `futarchy-api` |
| Runner | `npm run auto-qa:e2e` (separate from `npm run auto-qa:test`) |
| Owner | TBD |
| First-pass deadline | TBD |

## Effort breakdown (rough, per component)

| Component | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anvil fork + block clock + tx replay | S (1 wk) | Foundry already does this |
| Synthetic wallet stub for Playwright | M (2 wk) | Synpress mostly works; futarchy custom auth flows are the gotcha |
| Local Checkpoint indexer in CI | L (3 wk) | Schema migrations + warm-up time make this brittle |
| Cross-layer invariant DSL + assertion library | M (2 wk) | Has to be readable enough to debug failures |
| Scenario library (5-10 historical replays) | L (3 wk) | Each historical proposal needs careful state capture |
| OCR / DOM-equivalent price extraction | M (2 wk) | Brittle without good test IDs in the UI |
| Chaos injection + RPC fault library | S (1 wk) | tc/iptables wrapper |
| CI infra (compose, artifact capture, video on fail) | M (2 wk) | Probably the biggest day-2 cost |
| **Total** | **~3-4 months for one engineer** | |

## Phasing

Each phase is independently useful — we can stop at any phase boundary and
still have value.

| # | Phase | Effort | Stop-here value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Scaffold | 1-2 hrs | `harness/` dirs, deps, README, npm script skeleton, PROGRESS entries |
| 1 | Anvil fork + block clock | ~1 wk | Deterministic time control over a forked Gnosis chain |
| 2 | Chain ↔ api agreement (1 invariant) | ~1 wk | First cross-layer check working end-to-end |
| 3 | Local Checkpoint indexer in-loop | ~3 wks | Indexer reconciles with chain after each block |
| 4 | Synthetic wallet + first scripted swap | ~2 wks | Real on-chain mutation, full chain↔indexer↔api check |
| 5 | Playwright + DOM↔API assertions | ~3 wks | Frontend in the loop; UI consistency catches |
| 6 | Scenario library (replay 1 historical proposal) | ~2 wks | First "real bug shape" replayable |
| 7 | Chaos injection + nightly CI | ~2 wks | Production-shape resilience signal |

Single docker-compose starts all four services. Orchestrator owns the clock.

## Cross-layer invariants

| Layer A | vs | Layer B | Invariant |
|---|---|---|---|
| chain | vs | indexer | every Swap event present, same token amounts, same sqrtPrice |
| indexer | vs | api `/candles/graphql` | candle aggregates match raw swaps |
| api `/spot-candles` | vs | api `/candles/graphql` | rate-applied prices reconcile |
| api `/v2/.../chart` | vs | indexer raw | unified-chart shape consistent |
| frontend DOM | vs | api response | every visible price/volume/TVL matches the API call that produced it |
| playwright wallet swap | vs | chain receipt | tx mined, balance delta correct, conditional tokens minted |

## Economic invariants (always-on)

- **Conservation**: ∑(YES + NO conditional tokens) = ∑(sDAI deposited) at every block
- **Monotonicity**: TWAP window endpoints respect contract's `min(now, twapEnd)` clamp
- **Probability**: price ∈ [0, 1] for PREDICTION pools
- **No phantom mints**: `balanceOfBatch` sums match historical + synthetic deposits
- **Rate sanity**: sDAI rate from on-chain `getRate()` ≥ 1 and monotonically increasing

## Bug shapes this catches that nothing else can

- Indexer/chain divergence after a reorg or schema change
- Frontend showing stale numbers when the API is healthy (PR #64 shape)
- Conservation breaks from new merge/split paths
- TWAP window off-by-one at the resolution boundary (PR #54 shape)
- BUY/SELL inversion regressions in `subgraphTradesClient.js`
- Multi-RPC fallback being silently broken
- Wallet-flow regressions in `useFutarchy`
- Cross-protocol price drift between Algebra / CoW / Sushi quoters

## Open decisions (deferred to per-phase work)

- **Foundry vs Hardhat** for the fork — leaning Foundry/anvil (faster, simpler RPC)
- **Local Checkpoint vs subgraph** — Checkpoint matches production but harder to bootstrap
- **Synpress vs custom wallet stub** for Playwright — Synpress is canonical but futarchy's custom flows may need extension
- **Scenario capture format** — JSON snapshot of (block range, tx list, expected end-state) vs full state-dump replay
- **CI execution model** — nightly cron vs manually-triggered workflow vs PR-gated

## Iteration log

### Phase 0 — Scaffold

- **slice 1** — README, harness package.json with stub scripts,
  .gitignore, root `npm run auto-qa:e2e` wired through
  `npm --prefix auto-qa/harness run phase-status`. Verified the stub
  prints the phase status from the repo root. No deps installed yet.

- **slice 2** — `playwright.config.mjs` skeleton committed as PLAIN JS
  (NOT importing `@playwright/test` since it's not installed yet).
  Documents the eventual config: testDir → flows/, browser matrix
  (chromium-first, firefox/webkit deferred to Phase 7), trace/screenshot/
  video on failure, baseURL from `HARNESS_FRONTEND_URL` env, webServer
  block to auto-launch local Next.js dev server, viewport 1440x900,
  120s test timeout. Self-test mode prints the planned shape.

- **slice 3** — `fixtures/wallet-stub.mjs` placeholder. Exports
  `REQUIRED_METHODS` (18 EIP-1193 methods derived from grep across the
  futarchy interface — eth_accounts, eth_requestAccounts, eth_chainId,
  wallet_switchEthereumChain, wallet_addEthereumChain, personal_sign,
  eth_signTypedData_v4, eth_sendTransaction, eth_estimateGas,
  eth_gasPrice, eth_getTransactionReceipt, eth_getTransactionByHash,
  eth_call, eth_getBalance, eth_blockNumber, eth_getCode, eth_subscribe,
  eth_unsubscribe) and `REQUIRED_EVENTS` (5 events).
  `installWalletStub` + `nStubWallets` throw "not implemented" with
  pointers to ADR-001.

- **slice 4** — `ARCHITECTURE.md` cross-repo handshake doc. Identical
  copy lives in `futarchy-api/auto-qa/harness/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  Documents the 5-service topology, repo split table, boot sequence,
  invariant catalogue, sibling-clone instructions, and 5 deferred
  open questions.

- **slice 5** — `docs/ADR-001-synpress-vs-custom-stub.md` written by
  background agent. **Decision: custom EIP-1193 stub.** Injected via
  Playwright `addInitScript`, announced as an EIP-6963 provider for
  RainbowKit auto-discovery, wraps an `ethers.Wallet` (v5, matching the
  main app), proxies non-signing methods to anvil. Wins on multi-account
  parallelism, anvil dev-key handling, ~0 MB CI footprint, sub-50 ms
  per-context boot, cross-browser reach, and a stable 9-method
  maintenance surface. Synpress only wins on real-MetaMask UX realism
  + complete EIP-1193 coverage; both addressed later via a separate
  nightly smoke. Risk to address before Phase 5: 1-day spike on
  `eth_subscribe` shim.

- **slice 6** — `npm install` ran cleanly in `auto-qa/harness/`,
  generating `package-lock.json` (304 bytes — empty deps tree, but
  reproducible for future additions). Verified no pollution of root
  `package.json` install.

- **slice 7** — `docker compose config` validation handled on the
  futarchy-api side (the compose file lives there); on this side
  Phase 0 has no compose surface to validate. Verified that the npm
  scripts in `auto-qa/harness/package.json` resolve cleanly via
  `npm run` from the harness dir.

- **slice 8** — `CHECKLIST.md` mirrored across both repos. Enumerates
  Phase 0 → Phase 7 readiness gates plus 3 cross-cutting acceptance
  gates (no production code mods, no real mainnet RPC during runs,
  harness deps isolated from root). All Phase 0 mechanical items
  checked; 2 human-gated items remain (ADR human review + full
  sister-link clone verification on a clean machine).

**Phase 0 status: code-complete.** Two human-gated items in
`CHECKLIST.md` remain before declaring Phase 0 done and starting
Phase 1:

  1. Both ADRs reviewed by a human + status changed from "Proposed"
     to "Accepted"
  2. Sister-link verified: a fresh `git clone` of both repos in
     `~/code/futarchy-fi/` runs `docker compose config` cleanly
     (the snippet in `ARCHITECTURE.md` is correct as written, but
     hasn't been exercised on a clean machine yet)

### Phase 4 — Synthetic wallet + first scripted swap (UI side)

- **slice 1** (this iteration) — wallet stub `createProvider` shipped
  + Spike-002 resolved + nStubWallets shipped + 8-case live-anvil
  test passes.

  - **Spike-002** (`docs/spike-002-eth-subscribe-shim.md`, by
    background agent): `eth_subscribe` over HTTP — anvil 1.5.0 returns
    -32601 directly. viem only emits eth_subscribe via WS/IPC
    transports, never EIP-1193. The futarchy app uses
    `fallback(http(...))` so its watchers already poll. viem's
    `useWaitForTransactionReceipt` hard-codes `poll: true`
    (`waitForTransactionReceipt.ts:200-208`). **Decision: reject
    eth_subscribe with -32601** (3 lines in stub). No shim
    infrastructure needed.

  - `fixtures/wallet-stub.mjs` REWRITTEN from placeholder:
    - `createProvider({privateKey, rpcUrl, chainId})` returns an
      EIP-1193 provider wrapping a viem account
    - 9 wallet-local methods handled in-stub: eth_accounts,
      eth_requestAccounts, eth_chainId, wallet_switchEthereumChain
      (emits chainChanged), wallet_addEthereumChain, personal_sign,
      eth_sign, eth_signTypedData_v4, eth_sendTransaction
    - 14 RPC passthrough methods → forwarded to anvil verbatim
    - 2 subscription methods → reject with -32601
    - `isMetaMask: true` so RainbowKit auto-discovers
    - `installWalletStub` (browser-injection) still throws — that's
      Phase 5
  - `nStubWallets(N)` derives canonical anvil dev addresses from
    foundry mnemonic via viem's `mnemonicToAccount` + HDKey:
    [0]=0xf39F…, [1]=0x7099…, [2]=0x3C44…
  - `tests/smoke-wallet-stub.test.mjs`: 8 cases, 5s runtime
    - 4 constructor-error cases (no config, missing fields, bad types)
    - 2 nStubWallets cases (canonical addresses, n validation)
    - 1 method-classification sanity (sets non-overlapping)
    - 1 LIVE-ANVIL end-to-end: spawns anvil, exercises eth_accounts,
      eth_chainId, wallet_switchEthereumChain (with chainChanged
      emission), eth_blockNumber passthrough, eth_sendTransaction
      (signed via viem, mined, receipt status 0x1, sender debited
      correctly), personal_sign, eth_subscribe rejection
  - npm scripts wired: `wallet:demo`, `smoke:wallet`, `test`;
    root `auto-qa:e2e:smoke:wallet`, `auto-qa:e2e:wallet:demo`

  **Real anvil-fork quirk caught** — pinned in test as a diagnostic:
  on a Gnosis fork, after a successful 1-ETH transfer between anvil
  dev addresses, recipient's `eth_getBalance` reads as 0 (not
  pre+1ETH) even though the tx receipt is `status: 0x1` and the
  sender is debited correctly. NOT a wallet-stub bug — surfaces
  some interaction between anvil's fork mode and pre-funded dev
  accounts. Tracked for follow-up; receipt-status + sender-debit
  are the load-bearing assertions.

- **slice 3** (this iteration) — RESOLVED the recipient-balance
  quirk from slice 1.

  - `scripts/debug-balance-quirk.mjs` (new): spawns anvil, runs the
    same 1-ETH-transfer scenario via RAW JSON-RPC (no viem, no
    wallet stub) across 4 recipient address kinds:
      1. anvil dev[1] (0x70997970…) — recipient credit = -10000 ETH ✗
      2. vanity 0xff…ffff — credit = +1 ETH ✓
      3. fresh random address — credit = +1 ETH ✓
      4. low non-zero 0x0…0001 — credit = +1 ETH ✓

  - **Diagnosis**: anvil's "10000 ETH" auto-funding for dev addresses
    on a fork is a LAZY view — the underlying fork state is whatever
    the address has on Gnosis (~0). On first incoming tx, the lazy
    10000 ETH vanishes and the true fork balance materializes.
    Sender behavior is unaffected. NOT a wallet stub bug; NOT a viem
    bug; pure anvil fork-mode behavior.

  - **Fix** in `tests/smoke-wallet-stub.test.mjs`: switched recipient
    from `wallets[1].address` (anvil dev[1]) to a freshly-generated
    address via `viem.generatePrivateKey() → privateKeyToAccount`.
    Recipient assertion now real: `delta === 1 ETH`. Quirk
    documented in test header for future contributors.

  - All 8 wallet-stub tests pass in ~4s with REAL recipient credit
    asserted (not the previous diagnostic-only stub).

  - `@noble/curves` + `@noble/hashes` were tentatively added during
    debug then dropped — the script uses viem's `generatePrivateKey`
    + `privateKeyToAccount` which already covers fresh-address
    generation. (deps remain in package.json — future cleanup if
    we never need them.)

- **slice 2** (this iteration) — `scripts/contracts.mjs` +
  `tests/smoke-contract-calls.test.mjs`. Foundation for scripted
  contract calls (read + write + event-decode). Reuses the existing
  Gnosis fork — no new contracts to deploy, since the real ones
  ARE already on the fork.

  - `scripts/contracts.mjs`: viem-based helpers (`readContract`,
    `writeContract`, `getReceipt`, `parseEventLogs`, `publicClient`).
    ABIs: `ERC20_ABI`, `WXDAI_ABI` (with WETH9-style Deposit/
    Withdrawal events), `RATE_PROVIDER_ABI`. Address constants for
    `sDAI` (0xaf2…701), `sDAI_RATE_PROVIDER` (0x89C…CeD), `WXDAI`
    (0xe91…97d) sourced from production code.

  - `tests/smoke-contract-calls.test.mjs` (new, 1 test, ~5.5s):
    * READ paths (4): sDAI symbol="sDAI", decimals=18,
      totalSupply=62.4M sDAI (real live state), sDAI rate=1.239
      (real live monotonically-increasing rate)
    * WRITE path: wallet deposits 1 ETH into WXDAI via
      `writeContract`, tx mines (status=0x1), parseEventLogs decodes
      the Deposit(dst, wad) event, balance check confirms +1 WXDAI
      on wallet

  - **Discovery during slice 2**: WXDAI follows the WETH9 pattern —
    `deposit()` emits `Deposit(dst, wad)`, NOT ERC20 `Transfer`.
    Topic hash `0xe1fffcc4923d04b559f4d29a8bfc6cda04eb5b0d3c460751c2402c5c5cc9109c`
    = `keccak256("Deposit(address,uint256)")`. Test initially
    expected `Transfer` and failed; pinpointed via diagnostic of the
    raw log topics. Updated `WXDAI_ABI` and the test header to pin
    the correct event shape. Production code grep confirmed no
    callers assume `Transfer` from WXDAI (no production bug).

  - npm scripts: `smoke:contracts`, `contracts:demo` in harness;
    `auto-qa:e2e:smoke:contracts`, `auto-qa:e2e:contracts:demo`
    at root.

**Smoke summary (UI side, post-Phase 4 slices 1+2+3):**

```
Phase 4 wallet-stub (8 cases)             ✓ ~4s
Phase 4 contract-calls (1 case, 4 reads + 1 write + event decode + bal check)
                                           ✓ ~5.5s
                                  TOTAL: 9 pass + 0 skip
```

**Phase 4 wrap-up — remaining:**

- slice 4 — End-to-end roundtrip test combining wallet stub +
  Phase 3 indexer: send tx via wallet → mine → indexer observes →
  api passthrough returns it. Gated on Docker Desktop start.
- slice 5 (post-Phase 4) — Futarchy-specific contract surface:
  add ABIs for FutarchyProposalFactory, AlgebraPool, sDAI deposit/
  withdraw. Once Phase 3 indexer is live, deposit sDAI then verify
  the futarchy events flow into the indexer + api.

### Phase 5 — Playwright + DOM↔API assertions (UI side)

- **slice 1** (this iteration) — browser-injection smoke. The
  goal: prove the wallet stub installed via Playwright actually
  takes hold in a real chromium page, before we wire it to the
  futarchy app. Kept the slice deliberately narrow: connection +
  read paths only, no signing, no Next.js dev server.

  - **Tooling:**
    - `@playwright/test ^1.59.1` added to harness devDependencies
    - chromium browser binary provisioned via
      `npx playwright install chromium` (~92 MiB headless shell +
      ffmpeg)
    - `playwright.config.mjs` REWRITTEN from placeholder to use
      real `defineConfig({...})`. Single `chromium` project (firefox
      + webkit deferred to Phase 7). `webServer` block auto-launches
      Next.js dev unless `HARNESS_NO_WEBSERVER=1` (slice 1 opts out
      since we're testing pure injection, not the app).

  - **`installWalletStub` browser wrapper** (in
    `fixtures/wallet-stub.mjs`) — was a placeholder that threw, now
    returns a self-executing JS source string suitable for
    `context.addInitScript`. The script:
    * Sets `window.ethereum` with `isMetaMask: true`,
      `isHarness: true`, `selectedAddress`, `chainId`
    * Implements eth_accounts/eth_requestAccounts/eth_chainId/
      wallet_switchEthereumChain (with chainChanged emission) /
      wallet_addEthereumChain in-page
    * Rejects signing methods with -32601 (slice 2 will inline
      @noble/secp256k1 to enable in-page signing)
    * Rejects subscription methods with -32601 per Spike-002
    * Forwards all other methods (eth_blockNumber, eth_call, etc.)
      via `fetch` to the configured RPC URL
    * Announces itself via EIP-6963 `announceProvider` event +
      listens for `requestProvider` to re-announce (lets
      RainbowKit's discovery mechanism find it even if Wagmi
      hydrates before injection finishes)
    * Dispatches `ethereum#initialized` for late-hydrating dApps
    * Address is derived in node from privateKey (no viem
      bundled into the page)

  - **`flows/wallet-injection.spec.mjs`** — first browser-context
    test file. 6 cases against `about:blank`, all green in 2.4s:
    1. window.ethereum exposes the configured address + chain
       (hasEth, isMetaMask, isHarness, accounts, chainId,
       selectedAddress)
    2. wallet_switchEthereumChain emits chainChanged + new
       eth_chainId reflects the switch
    3. eth_subscribe rejected with -32601 (per Spike-002)
    4. Signing methods (personal_sign, eth_signTypedData_v4,
       eth_sendTransaction) all rejected with -32601 (slice 2
       will enable)
    5. EIP-6963 announcement fires — listener registered before
       requestProvider dispatch catches the replay
    6. eth_blockNumber forwards to the configured RPC

  - **CORS / null-origin gotcha resolved**: First attempt at the
    eth_blockNumber test ran a real http server and made the page
    fetch it cross-origin. Failed with "TypeError: Failed to fetch"
    even after adding permissive CORS headers + OPTIONS preflight.
    Root cause: chromium drops fetches from `about:blank` (null
    origin) to local addresses regardless of CORS. **Fix**: switched
    to `context.route(MOCK_RPC_URL, ...)` — Playwright intercepts
    at the network layer before chromium's null-origin check, so the
    fetch never has to leave the browser. Pinned in the test header
    so future contributors don't re-litigate.

  - **npm scripts wired**: `ui` / `ui:ui` / `ui:report` in
    harness `package.json`; `auto-qa:e2e:ui` and `auto-qa:e2e:ui:ui`
    at interface root.

**Smoke summary (UI side, post-Phase 5 slice 1):**

```
Phase 4 wallet-stub (8 cases, node:test + live anvil)  ✓ ~4s
Phase 4 contract-calls (1 case, reads+write+event)     ✓ ~5.5s
Phase 5 wallet-injection (6 cases, chromium)           ✓ ~2.4s
                                       TOTAL: 15 pass + 0 skip
```

- **slice 2** (this iteration) — in-page signing via tunnel.
  Original plan said "inline @noble/secp256k1 in the page"; took
  a sharply better path: use Playwright's `exposeBinding` to
  register a node-side handler that the in-page stub calls for
  any SIGNING_METHODS request. The privateKey lives in node, the
  page only sees the signature/hash result, and we reuse viem's
  well-tested `signMessage` / `signTypedData` / `sendTransaction`
  helpers — ~30 lines of fixture code instead of bundling and
  embedding ~30 KB of ESM crypto + EIP-712 hashing + EIP-1559
  serialization as a string blob in `addInitScript`.

  - **`setupSigningTunnel(context, {privateKey, rpcUrl, chainId})`**
    in `fixtures/wallet-stub.mjs`:
    * Validates inputs, builds a viem `walletClient` with
      `account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey)` + `chain` +
      `transport: http(rpcUrl)`
    * Calls `context.exposeBinding('__harnessSign', handler)` so
      every page in the context gets `window.__harnessSign`
    * Handler dispatches on method:
        - `personal_sign` / `eth_sign` →
          `walletClient.signMessage`
        - `eth_signTypedData_v4` → parses JSON, calls
          `walletClient.signTypedData`
        - `eth_sendTransaction` → `walletClient.sendTransaction`
          (viem fetches nonce/chainId/gas + signs + broadcasts +
          returns tx hash)
    * Address mismatches throw with a clear message; viem-level
      errors propagate

  - **In-page stub change** (`installWalletStub` in same file):
    when a SIGNING_METHODS request comes in, check
    `typeof window.__harnessSign === 'function'`. If yes, forward
    via the binding and re-shape the result/error so EIP-1193's
    `.code` field is preserved. If no, keep slice-1 behavior and
    reject -32601. This means slice-1's "signing methods rejected"
    test STILL passes unchanged (no tunnel installed = no
    signing = -32601). Confirmed in the green re-run.

  - **`flows/wallet-signing.spec.mjs`** — 3 browser tests, all
    green in ~5s combined:
    1. `personal_sign` — page calls
       `eth_accounts` then `personal_sign("Hello, harness! …")`,
       node uses `viem.recoverMessageAddress({message, signature})`
       and asserts equality with `wallet.address`
    2. `eth_signTypedData_v4` — minimal `Greeting{from,message}`
       EIP-712 payload; page signs; node uses
       `viem.recoverTypedDataAddress({...payload, signature})`;
       asserts equality
    3. `eth_sendTransaction` — spawns local anvil (skips when
       missing) and sends 0.5 XDAI from the wallet to a freshly-
       generated recipient (the dev-account lazy-funding quirk
       from Phase 4 slice 3 still applies, so recipient must be
       fresh). Polls `eth_getTransactionReceipt` because viem
       returns the hash before anvil's auto-mine settles.
       Asserts `receipt.status === '0x1'` and recipient balance
       == 0.5 XDAI

**Smoke summary (UI side, post-Phase 5 slice 2):**

```
Phase 4 wallet-stub (8 cases, node:test + live anvil)  ✓ ~4s
Phase 4 contract-calls (1 case, reads+write+event)     ✓ ~5.5s
Phase 5 wallet-injection (6 cases, chromium)           ✓ ~2.4s
Phase 5 wallet-signing (3 cases, chromium + anvil)     ✓ ~5.6s
                                       TOTAL: 18 pass + 0 skip
```

- **slice 3a** (this iteration) — futarchy Next.js dev server in
  the loop. First slice that actually navigates to a real page
  served by the futarchy app, instead of `about:blank`. The goal:
  prove `addInitScript` runs early enough that `window.ethereum`
  is set BEFORE app code (React, Wagmi, RainbowKit) reads it.

  - **`flows/app-discovery.spec.mjs`** — single test that:
    1. Skips when `HARNESS_NO_WEBSERVER=1` (slice 1+2 mode)
    2. Installs the wallet stub via `addInitScript` BEFORE goto
    3. Navigates to `/` (futarchy homepage) — `domcontentloaded`
       wait
    4. Asserts `window.ethereum.{isMetaMask,isHarness,
       selectedAddress}` from the page context match what was
       configured in node

  - **Bug fix discovered along the way**: slice 1's webServer
    block had `npm --prefix ../../.. run dev` — but from
    `auto-qa/harness/` that resolves to `/Users/kas/`, not the
    interface root. We never noticed because slice 1 + 2 ran with
    `HARNESS_NO_WEBSERVER=1`. Corrected to `../../`. Bumped
    webServer timeout from 120s to 180s (cold Next.js compile
    can take 30-90s).

  - **New npm scripts**: `ui:full` (drops HARNESS_NO_WEBSERVER) and
    `ui:full:ui` (interactive) in harness; `auto-qa:e2e:ui:full`
    and `auto-qa:e2e:ui:full:ui` at root.

  - **Knob**: `HARNESS_FRONTEND_RPC_URL` overrides the dev
    server's `NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL`. For this iteration, used
    `https://rpc.gnosischain.com` so the app can hydrate cleanly
    without needing a local anvil. Slice 3 onwards will swap to
    `http://localhost:<anvil>` once anvil is bundled into the
    full harness lifecycle.

  - **Validated end-to-end** — single run, cold Next.js compile,
    test passes:
    ```
    Phase 5 slice 3a app-discovery (1 case)              ✓ ~1.7s
    + cold Next.js compile + first navigation             ~17s
    Total wall-clock                                      ~20s
    ```

  - **Compile-time noise observed (pre-existing, not harness-
    introduced)**: MetaMask SDK warns about missing optional
    `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`; Next.js warns
    about a `<script>` tag in `next/head`. Both are app issues
    that don't break hydration; flagged here for context.

- **slice 3b** (this iteration) — RainbowKit Connect modal
  assertion. The slice 1 EIP-6963 test verified the announce
  fires against a synthetic listener; slice 3b verifies it
  actually reaches RainbowKit's discovery in the real app and
  surfaces our wallet by name in the connect modal. Slim test:

    1. Install wallet stub (no signing tunnel — modal-listing
       doesn't require signing)
    2. Navigate to `/companies` (Header runs in `app` config
       there; `/` is landing-only with just "Launch App")
    3. Click the "Connect Wallet" button (text-based locator;
       `.first()` because Header renders both desktop + mobile)
    4. `expect(page.getByText('Futarchy Harness Wallet'))
       .toBeVisible({timeout: 15s})` — the EIP-6963 announce
       reaches RainbowKit's modal and our wallet is listed by
       name from the EIP-6963 `info.name`

  - **Validated end-to-end** — both slice 3a + 3b tests pass
    against the warm dev server in 14.3s wall-clock (3.4s for
    slice 3b alone, including modal open animation + wallet-
    list render).

  - **Stretch deferred**: clicking the wallet in the modal and
    asserting a successful connect (account address visible in
    the header). Skipped for now because the post-click selectors
    are RainbowKit-version-sensitive; revisit during Phase 6
    scenario work where we actually need a connected wallet to
    drive a real swap.

- **slice 4 v1** (this iteration) — DOM↔API invariant
  **mechanism** proven end-to-end against the real futarchy app.
  Slice 4 v1 deliberately scopes down to a non-numeric value
  (an org name) so the mechanism lands first; numeric-price
  sub-slices follow once we know which formatter to assert
  against.

  - **Path picked**: `/companies` → `useAggregatorCompanies` hook
    → 3 GraphQL POSTs to `https://api.futarchy.fi/registry/graphql`
    (aggregator → organizations → proposalentities) →
    `transformOrgToCard(org).title = org.name` → renders in both
    `<CompaniesListCarousel>` (card) and `<OrganizationsTable>`
    (row). Found by reading
    `src/hooks/useAggregatorCompanies.js` +
    `src/config/subgraphEndpoints.js`.

  - **`flows/dom-api-invariant.spec.mjs`**:
    - `context.route('https://api.futarchy.fi/registry/graphql')`
      with a handler that parses POST body, dispatches on
      whether `query` contains `aggregator(id:` /
      `organizations(where:` / `proposalentities(where:`, and
      returns the canned response for each (probe values for
      aggregator + org, empty list for proposalentities)
    - Records call sequence so a future failure where the page
      DIDN'T issue the expected query is easy to diagnose
    - Navigates to `/companies`, asserts probe name visible in
      the DOM within 30s
    - Bonus: asserts `count() >= 1` so a future regression that
      drops one of the rendering paths still surfaces here

  - **First-run gotcha resolved**: assertion failed initially
    with strict-mode "resolved to 2 elements" — the probe value
    rendered in BOTH the card AND the table row. That's a feature,
    not a bug (the mock propagated through two independent
    consumers); switched to `.first()` + `count >= 1` and the
    test passes.

  - **Validated end-to-end**: 1 test, 3.3s. Wall-clock with
    warm dev server: 12.6s.

- **slice 4b** (this iteration) — first NUMERIC value through
  the mock → DOM-cell pipeline. Uses the same
  `flows/dom-api-invariant.spec.mjs` test file and the same
  `/companies` data path as 4a, so we get pure numeric-vs-string
  isolation: only the proposalentities mock changes between the
  two tests.

  - **Refactor**: extracted `makeGraphqlMockHandler({proposals,
    onCall})` into a parameterized helper. Tests pass different
    proposal lists; the handler dispatches identically. Shared
    `fakeProposal(idSuffix, metadataExtra)` builds a stub row in
    the shape `useAggregatorCompanies` expects.

  - **Test setup**: 8 proposals with empty metadata + 3 with
    `metadata = JSON.stringify({visibility: 'hidden'})`. Per
    `transformOrgToCard`:
    * `nonArchived` = `proposals.filter(!archived)` → 11
    * `active` = `nonArchived.filter(!hidden && !resolved)` → 8
    So `org.activeProposals` = 8 and `org.proposalsCount` = 11.

  - **Assertion**: scope to the row containing PROBE_ORG_NAME
    (must be unique — `toHaveCount(1)`), then assert
    `td.nth(2)` (Active column) = "8" and `td.nth(3)` (Total) =
    "11". Column indices come from
    `OrganizationsTable.jsx::<thead>` (Logo | Name | Active |
    Proposals | Chain).

  - **Validated end-to-end**: 1 test, 2.3s. Both 4a + 4b
    together: 15s wall-clock with warm dev server.

  - **Bug-shape this catches**: a regression in
    `transformOrgToCard`'s visibility filter (e.g. flipping the
    `!hidden` predicate, or accidentally including resolved
    proposals in active count) would surface as the active-cell
    showing "11" instead of "8". A regression in the underlying
    `parseMetadata` (e.g. crashing on JSON-stringified metadata
    instead of treating the missing field as undefined) would
    surface as both cells showing "0".

- **slice 4c v1** (this iteration) — int → enum mapping
  formatter through the same `/companies` data path. 4a proved
  string passthrough, 4b proved integer toString through filter
  logic, 4c v1 proves int → enum lookup. The original 4c spec
  (currency-formatted price like "$0.42") is more complex and
  needs a different page; staged as 4c v2 so we can keep
  shipping per-iteration.

  - **Refactor**: extended `makeGraphqlMockHandler` to accept
    `orgMetadata` — the string written to
    `organizations[0].metadata`. Defaults to `null` (4a/4b
    behavior unchanged); 4c sets it to
    `JSON.stringify({chain: '10'})`.

  - **Data flow**: per `useAggregatorCompanies::transformOrgToCard`:
    ```
    const meta = parseMetadata(org.metadata);  // JSON.parse
    const chainId = meta.chain ? parseInt(meta.chain, 10) : 100;
    ```
    Per `ChainBadge::CHAIN_CONFIG`:
    ```
    1 → 'ETH', 10 → 'Optimism', 100 → 'Gnosis',
    137 → 'Polygon', 42161 → 'Arbitrum'
    ```

  - **Test setup**: mock `metadata = JSON.stringify({chain: '10'})`,
    assert the row's chain cell (`td.nth(4)`) shows
    "Optimism". Default chainId=100 would render "Gnosis", so
    a regression in any link of the chain
    (parseMetadata / parseInt / CHAIN_CONFIG entry / ChainBadge
    rendering) lights up here.

  - **Validated end-to-end**: 1 new test, 1.4s. All 3
    dom-api-invariant tests together (4a + 4b + 4c): 21s
    wall-clock with Next.js cold compile.

  - **Bug-shapes this catches**:
    * `parseInt(meta.chain, 10)` breaks if someone changes
      `meta.chain` to expect a number (would render "Chain NaN")
    * `CHAIN_CONFIG[10].shortName` → silent rename ("Op" instead
      of "Optimism") would surface
    * `transformOrgToCard` regression that drops the chainId
      derivation would default to 100 → "Gnosis" instead

- **slice 4c v2** (this iteration) — chain enum FALLBACK
  formatter (template-literal branch). Same data path as 4c v1
  but exercises the OTHER branch in `ChainBadge.jsx` —
  the dynamic-template formatter that runs when the chainId
  isn't in CHAIN_CONFIG.

  - **Data flow**: mock `metadata.chain = '999'` →
    `parseInt('999', 10) = 999` → CHAIN_CONFIG[999] is undefined
    → fallback `{shortName: \`Chain ${chainId}\`}` →
    `td[4]` shows "Chain 999".

  - **Why a separate test from 4c v1**: 4c v1 covers the
    lookup-table branch (chainId in CHAIN_CONFIG). 4c v2 covers
    the fallback branch — a different code path that catches a
    different bug shape. A regression that drops the fallback
    case (e.g., crashes on missing key, or renders empty when
    the key is missing) would surface here, not in 4c v1.

  - **Validated end-to-end**: 1 new test, 1.4s. All 4
    dom-api-invariant tests together: 20.3s wall-clock with
    Next.js cold compile.

  - **Why staging the original 4c (currency) as 4c v3**: real
    currency formatting (`(v).toFixed(2) + ' ' + baseTokenSymbol`,
    `(v * 100).toFixed(0) + '%'`) lives in `HighlightCards` /
    `EventHighlightCard`, fed by the `collectAndFetchPoolPrices`
    pipeline that hits `api.futarchy.fi/candles/graphql` (a
    DIFFERENT endpoint from the registry one we already mock).
    Mocking it requires seeding each proposal with valid
    `prediction_pools`/`pools` references AND mocking the candles
    endpoint with matching pool prices. Larger lift; staged for
    a dedicated iteration so we can keep shipping per-tick.

- **slice 4c v3a** (this iteration) — candles pipeline
  plumbing. Splits the original 4c v3 ambition into two
  iterations: v3a proves the network reaches the candles
  endpoint with the right inputs; v3b (next) asserts the
  formatted DOM string. Plumbing-first because the candles
  pipeline involves a SECOND fetcher path
  (`fetchProposalsFromAggregator` from `useAggregatorProposals.js`,
  not `useAggregatorCompanies` — they query the same registry
  endpoint with DIFFERENT field selections, then the carousel
  side calls `collectAndFetchPoolPrices` which is the new bit).

  - **New fixtures in the test file**:
    * `CANDLES_GRAPHQL_URL` constant
    * `PROBE_POOL_YES` / `PROBE_POOL_NO` /
      `PROBE_PROPOSAL_ADDRESS` — distinctive addresses so any
      candles request mentioning them is unambiguously ours
    * `fakePoolBearingProposal({...})` — builds a proposal row in
      the carousel-side shape (includes `displayNameEvent`,
      `displayNameQuestion`, `description`, `proposalAddress`,
      `owner`); embeds `metadata.conditional_pools.{yes,no}.address`
    * `makeCandlesMockHandler({prices, onCall})` — parses the
      bulk-fetcher's `pools(where: id_in: [...])` query, returns
      only the pools the test seeded prices for, optionally
      records each query's address list

  - **Test "slice 4c v3a"**:
    1. Mock REGISTRY with our pool-bearing proposal
    2. Mock CANDLES with prices for both probe pool addresses;
       record each call's address list
    3. Navigate to `/companies` (which renders the carousel)
    4. `expect.poll(() => candlesCalls.length).toBeGreaterThan(0)`
    5. Assert the flattened address list contains
       `PROBE_POOL_YES`

  - **Validated end-to-end**: the carousel hits the candles
    endpoint, the bulk fetcher's `id_in` query carries our
    probe address, and our mock returns the price.
    Test runtime: 1.7s (full dom-api-invariant suite: 24.4s).

  - **What v3a deliberately doesn't do**: assert the DOM. The
    carousel might render a card variant that doesn't display
    the YES price (e.g., the resolved-event renderer), or it
    might filter our proposal due to the placeholder
    `proposalAddress`. v3b will trace which card path renders
    and which formatter's output is the visible string.

- **slice 4c v3b** (this iteration) — **THE CANONICAL PHASE 5
  INVARIANT, WIRED.** Built directly on v3a's plumbing: the
  candles mock now returns a known YES price (0.42) for our
  probe pool, and we assert the formatter's exact output string
  appears in the visible DOM.

  - **Path traced** (registry → candles → carousel → card →
    formatter → DOM):
    1. `EventsHighlightCarousel` calls
       `fetchEventHighlightData('all', {connectedWallet})`
    2. → `fetchProposalsFromAggregator(DEFAULT_AGGREGATOR)` →
       hits REGISTRY → returns proposals (our mocked one,
       enriched via `transformProposalToEvent` which derives
       `poolAddresses: {yes, no}` from
       `metadata.conditional_pools`)
    3. → `collectAndFetchPoolPrices(events)` → groups pools by
       chain, hits CANDLES with `pools(where: id_in: [...])` →
       returns `priceMap`
    4. → `attachPrefetchedPrices(events, priceMap)` mutates
       each event: `event.prefetchedPrices = {yes, no, source}`
    5. carousel renders `<EventHighlightCard prefetchedPrices=…/>`
       (`useNewCard=false` is the CompaniesPage default — checked)
    6. `useLatestPoolPrices` short-circuits to prefetched
       values when present
    7. Formatter: `${prices.yes.toFixed(precision)} ${baseTokenSymbol}`
       — precision=4 because YES<1 triggers the high-precision
       branch; baseTokenSymbol='SDAI' because
       `metadata.currencyTokens.base.tokenSymbol` is unset →
       DOM string **"0.4200 SDAI"**

  - **Test "slice 4c v3b"**:
    1. Mock REGISTRY with `fakePoolBearingProposal({})`
       (proposalAddress / displayNames / conditional_pools all
       set to PROBE_* constants)
    2. Mock CANDLES with `prices: {[YES]: 0.42, [NO]: 0.58}`
    3. Navigate to `/companies`
    4. Pre-flight assertion: event title
       "HARNESS-PROBE-EVENT-001" visible (proves the proposal
       got past visibility/resolved/etc. filters)
    5. Canonical assertion: "0.4200 SDAI" visible (proves the
       full formatter chain renders the mocked price)

  - **Validated end-to-end** — passed first try. Test runtime:
    1.3s in parallel, 3.8s solo. Full 6-test
    dom-api-invariant suite: 22.6s wall-clock with cold compile.

  - **Bug-shapes this catches** (the load-bearing one):
    * Stale-price-but-API-healthy class (PR #64 shape from
      interface): if the prefetched-price path got short-
      circuited or `attachPrefetchedPrices` no-op'd, the card
      would fall back to its own per-pool fetch (which we DON'T
      mock here) and show "0.00 SDAI" or LoadingSpinner. The
      assert-on-"0.4200 SDAI" lights up that regression.
    * Formatter precision regression: dropping the
      `shouldUseHighPrecision` check would render "0.42 SDAI"
      instead of "0.4200 SDAI" → fails immediately.
    * baseTokenSymbol fallback regression: changing the default
      from 'SDAI' to e.g. 'XDAI' → fails immediately.

**Smoke summary (UI side, post-Phase 5 slice 4c v3b):**

```
Phase 4 wallet-stub (8 cases, node:test + live anvil)  ✓ ~4s
Phase 4 contract-calls (1 case, reads+write+event)     ✓ ~5.5s
Phase 5 wallet-injection (6 cases, chromium)           ✓ ~2.4s
Phase 5 wallet-signing (3 cases, chromium + anvil)     ✓ ~5.6s
Phase 5 app-discovery (2 cases, chromium + Next.js)    ✓ ~14s
Phase 5 dom-api-invariant (6 cases, chromium + Next.js) ✓ ~14s
                                       TOTAL: 26 pass + 0 skip
```

**Phase 5 status: substantively COMPLETE.** The CHECKLIST gate
("First DOM↔API check: navigate to a proposal page, scrape the
visible price, compare to the api response that produced it") is
met — slice 4c v3b is exactly that, and v3a/v2/v1/4b/4a are the
on-ramps to it.

**Remaining sub-slice (deferred, not Phase 5 acceptance-critical):**

- **4d** — cross-protocol price reconciliation: when multiple
  sources (Algebra / CoW / Sushi) should agree, mock each to
  slightly-different values and assert the UI either flags the
  divergence or picks the right canonical source. Catches the
  BUY/SELL inversion / multi-RPC silent breakage bug shapes.
  More advanced bug-probe; can land out-of-order with Phase 6.

### Phase 6 — Scenario library (UI side)

- **slice 1** (this iteration) — scenario format decided.
  CHECKLIST gate "Scenario capture format decided (JSON snapshot
  vs full state dump)" was originally framed in chain-snapshot
  terms. The actual design space turned out broader (4 options:
  pure JSON, executable `.scenario.mjs` modules, naming
  conventions on regular `.spec.mjs` files, full anvil state
  dump). The trade-offs are walked through in
  `interface/auto-qa/harness/docs/ADR-002-scenario-format.md`.

  - **Decision**: Option B — executable `.scenario.mjs` modules
    in `auto-qa/harness/scenarios/`, exporting a `Scenario` object
    with `{name, description, bugShape, route, mocks, assertions}`.

  - **Rationale**:
    * Reuses the existing fixture vocabulary
      (`makeGraphqlMockHandler`, `makeCandlesMockHandler`,
      `fakePoolBearingProposal`, `installWalletStub`,
      `setupSigningTunnel`) directly. JSON option would have
      required porting all of it into a JSON-interpreting shim.
    * Phase 6's stop-here value is "first real bug shape
      replayable" — achievable today via mocked-API + DOM
      assertions, since slice 4c v3b's stale-price-but-API-healthy
      regression already proves the pattern.
    * Auto-generation from a real chain recording (the JSON
      appeal) isn't a Phase 6 deliverable. If it becomes one,
      JSON can wrap `.scenario.mjs` (parser → `Scenario` object
      at load time).
    * Full-stack snapshot (Option D, the original CHECKLIST
      framing) deferred to Phase 7 chaos work or to the first
      scenario that genuinely needs anvil state inexpressible
      via mocks.

  - **Structure landed**:
    * `interface/auto-qa/harness/docs/ADR-002-scenario-format.md`
      (Status: Proposed)
    * `interface/auto-qa/harness/scenarios/` directory with
      `README.md` documenting the format + naming convention
      (`<NN>-<short-name>.scenario.mjs`)

  - **Format definition** (binding for Phase 6):
    ```ts
    type Scenario = {
        name:        string;            // "01-stale-price-shape"
        description: string;            // 1-2 sentences
        bugShape:    string;            // e.g. "PR #64 stale price"
        route:       string;            // e.g. "/companies"
        mocks:       Record<string, RouteHandler>;  // url → Playwright handler
        assertions:  Array<(page: Page) => Promise<void>>;
        timeout?:    number;
    };
    ```

  - **Open items deferred to slice 2+**:
    * Per-scenario wallet state (does the scenario need a
      `nStubWallets` selection / signing tunnel? probably yes —
      add an optional `wallet` field when first needed)
    * Cross-repo scenarios (a scenario needing both real anvil +
      real api would live on the api-side)
    * Catalog generation script (`SCENARIOS.md` index — pin
      when ≥3 scenarios exist)

- **slice 2** (this iteration) — first scenario captured +
  wrapper spec runner. **Phase 6's "first real bug shape
  replayable" gate is now MET.**

  - **Mock-helper extraction**: moved
    `makeGraphqlMockHandler`, `makeCandlesMockHandler`,
    `fakeProposal`, `fakePoolBearingProposal`, and the PROBE_*
    constants out of `flows/dom-api-invariant.spec.mjs` into a
    new shared module `fixtures/api-mocks.mjs`. The spec file
    now imports from there. Rationale: scenarios need the same
    helpers and importing from a spec file is awkward.

  - **First scenario** —
    `scenarios/01-stale-price-shape.scenario.mjs`. Lifts slice 4c
    v3b's exact mock setup + assertions into the Scenario format
    defined by ADR-002. Guards the PR #64 stale-price-but-API-
    healthy bug shape (mocked candles GraphQL → "0.4200 SDAI" via
    EventHighlightCard's prefetched-price short-circuit).

  - **Wrapper spec** — `flows/scenarios.spec.mjs`:
    * Top-level `await` discovers `scenarios/*.scenario.mjs`
      and dynamically imports each (Playwright sees the full test
      list at collection time).
    * For each scenario, emits one
      `test('<name> — <bugShape>', …)` that:
      1. Skips if `HARNESS_NO_WEBSERVER=1` (scenarios always need
         the dev server)
      2. Installs the default wallet stub (every scenario needs
         `window.ethereum` for wagmi/RainbowKit hydration)
      3. Applies each entry of `scenario.mocks` via `context.route`
      4. Navigates to `scenario.route`
      5. Runs `scenario.assertions[i](page)` in order

  - **Validated end-to-end** — 7 tests pass when run together
    (6 dom-api-invariant + 1 scenario): the extracted helpers
    work in both contexts; the scenario format produces a
    correct test from a pure data structure. Wall-clock 22.6s
    with cold compile.

  - **`scenarios/README.md`** updated with a "Current scenarios"
    table indexing the captured scenarios. Becomes the human-
    readable bug-shape catalog as scenarios accumulate.

- **slice 3** (back-fill, this iteration's primary work) —
  `scripts/scenarios-catalog.mjs` (~70 lines) auto-generates
  `scenarios/SCENARIOS.md` from each scenario's `bugShape`
  field. Sliced 3 was originally deferred ("worth doing once
  we have ≥3 scenarios"); landing 03-candles-down in Phase 7
  slice 2 unblocked it. Looped back to ship.

  - **What the script does**:
    1. `readdirSync(scenarios/)` filter `*.scenario.mjs`, sort
    2. `await Promise.all(files.map(...))` — dynamic-import
       each scenario module
    3. Validate required fields (`name` / `description` /
       `bugShape` / `route`); throw with file context if any
       are missing
    4. Build a markdown table; escape `|` in bugShape /
       description so the table layout survives content with
       pipes
    5. `writeFileSync(scenarios/SCENARIOS.md, ...)`

  - **npm scripts**: `scenarios:catalog` in harness;
    `auto-qa:e2e:scenarios:catalog` at root. Both forms work.

  - **README.md slimmed**: the per-file notes table is now
    "authoring notes" (one cell per file: why-this-scenario-
    exists context). The canonical bug-shape index lives in
    the auto-generated `SCENARIOS.md` so PRs that add scenarios
    don't have to update two files.

  - **Drift gate**: future CI step can `npm run auto-qa:e2e:scenarios:catalog`
    then `git diff --exit-code scenarios/SCENARIOS.md` to fail
    builds where the catalog is out of date with the scenarios
    directory. Pinned in CHECKLIST as a Phase 7 slice 3 (CI
    integration) item.

  - **Validated end-to-end**: ran the script, got
    `✓ Wrote /Users/kas/interface/auto-qa/harness/scenarios/SCENARIOS.md (3 scenarios)`,
    inspected the output — all 3 scenarios indexed correctly
    with the right bug-shape strings, routes, descriptions.

**Phase 6 status: COMPLETE.** All three CHECKLIST gates met
(format decided, first scenario captured, wrapper-spec replay +
catalog generator both in place).

**Smoke summary (UI side, post-Phase 6 slice 3):**

```
Phase 4 wallet-stub (8 cases, node:test + live anvil)  ✓ ~4s
Phase 4 contract-calls (1 case, reads+write+event)     ✓ ~5.5s

                                       TOTAL: 29 pass + 0 skip
```

### Phase 7 — Chaos injection + nightly CI (UI side)

- **slice 1** (this iteration) — first chaos primitive landed
  via the Phase 6 scenario format. Validates the design choice
  in ADR-002: "executable `.scenario.mjs` modules" composes with
  chaos because mock handlers can return any HTTP status, not
  just 200. No format change needed.

  - **`scenarios/02-registry-down.scenario.mjs`**: mocks
    REGISTRY GraphQL → `route.fulfill({status: 502, body:
    {errors:[{message:'Bad Gateway (chaos: registry-down)'}]}})`,
    asserts `/companies` shows "No organizations found" within
    30s. The empty-state branch lives in
    `OrganizationsTable.jsx::filteredOrgs.length === 0` — it
    fires when both `useAggregatorCompanies` AND the carousel-
    side `fetchProposalsFromAggregator` return empty results
    after their `.catch` branches handle the 502.

  - **Bug-shapes guarded**:
    * Hard-crash on REGISTRY 5xx (page becomes unusable)
    * Hung loading spinner with no terminal state
    * Raw error envelope leaked to UI ("Bad Gateway: …" text)
    * Silent broken state that fakes success

  - **Composability proof**: the wrapper spec from Phase 6
    slice 2 auto-discovered the new scenario without ANY code
    change — adding a future bug-shape regression is a single
    new file. This is the "scenario library" working as
    intended.

  - **Validated end-to-end**: the wrapper spec ran both 01
    (happy-path) AND 02 (chaos) and both pass. 02 alone: 2.4s.
    Both together: 20s wall-clock with cold compile.

  - **Phase 7 — staging the rest**: slice 2 = more chaos
    primitives (CANDLES timeout, WALLET RPC failure, mid-flight
    failure); slice 3 = CI integration (nightly cron + artifact
    upload); slice 4 = full-stack docker-compose. Per
    CHECKLIST.md.

**Smoke summary (UI side, post-Phase 7 slice 1):**

```
Phase 4 wallet-stub (8 cases, node:test + live anvil)  ✓ ~4s
Phase 4 contract-calls (1 case, reads+write+event)     ✓ ~5.5s
Phase 5 wallet-injection (6 cases, chromium)           ✓ ~2.4s
Phase 5 wallet-signing (3 cases, chromium + anvil)     ✓ ~5.6s
Phase 5 app-discovery (2 cases, chromium + Next.js)    ✓ ~14s
Phase 5 dom-api-invariant (6 cases, chromium + Next.js) ✓ ~14s
Phase 6+7 scenarios (2 cases, chromium + Next.js)      ✓ ~5s
                                       TOTAL: 28 pass + 0 skip
```

- **slice 2** (this iteration) — CANDLES-down branch added.
  Companion to slice 1's REGISTRY-down: where 02 takes the
  carousel-source out so nothing renders, 03 keeps the carousel
  source healthy so a card mounts, then takes the SECOND-tier
  pricing source out.

  - **`scenarios/03-candles-down.scenario.mjs`**: mocks
    REGISTRY → success (carousel renders our event card),
    CANDLES → 502 (both bulk prefetch AND per-pool fallback
    fail). Asserts event title visible AND "0.00 SDAI" visible.

  - **Discovery while wiring this** (worth pinning): per
    `src/utils/SubgraphPoolFetcher.js`, the per-pool fetcher
    used by `useLatestPoolPrices` calls
    `getSubgraphEndpoint(chainId)` → CANDLES — the SAME
    endpoint `collectAndFetchPoolPrices` hits in the bulk-
    prefetch step. So a CANDLES outage takes BOTH layers down
    in one shot. There is no third-tier fallback; the formatter
    eventually settles on its `prices.yes !== null ? … : '0.00 SDAI'`
    branch and renders the literal "0.00 SDAI" string. This is
    actually a **harness-level architecture finding**: any
    future work that wants to test the per-pool fallback in
    isolation will need to make the bulk and per-pool fetchers
    hit different endpoints first.

  - **Bug-shapes guarded**:
    * Card hangs on LoadingSpinner when CANDLES is dead
      (loading state not unwound on fetch error)
    * Card crashes when prices come back null (formatter
      assumes non-null without the fallback branch)
    * Card shows stale or fake numbers (silent drift to a
      different pricing source that's not visibly distinguishable)

  - **Negative-companion benefit**: 03 also tightens the
    DOM↔API invariant on scenario 01. If someone later adds a
    silent default-price source ("if candles fails, use X
    instead"), scenario 01 might still pass spuriously, but
    scenario 03 fails because "0.00 SDAI" wouldn't appear
    anymore. The pair pins both the happy path AND the explicit
    failure path.

  - **Validated end-to-end**: 03 passes in 1.4s; all 3
    scenarios together: 20.3s wall-clock with cold compile.
    UI-side smoke now 29 pass + 0 skip.

  - **Phase 6 slice 3 unblocked**: with 3 scenarios in place,
    the `scenarios:catalog` script (originally deferred until
    ≥3 scenarios) is now worth writing. Re-tagged in CHECKLIST
    as "UNBLOCKED".

**Smoke summary (UI side, post-Phase 7 slice 2 candles-branch):**

```
Phase 4 wallet-stub (8 cases, node:test + live anvil)  ✓ ~4s
Phase 4 contract-calls (1 case, reads+write+event)     ✓ ~5.5s
Phase 5 wallet-injection (6 cases, chromium)           ✓ ~2.4s
Phase 5 wallet-signing (3 cases, chromium + anvil)     ✓ ~5.6s
Phase 5 app-discovery (2 cases, chromium + Next.js)    ✓ ~14s
Phase 5 dom-api-invariant (6 cases, chromium + Next.js) ✓ ~14s

                                       TOTAL: 29 pass + 0 skip
```

- **slice 2 partial branch** (this iteration) — `04-candles-partial`
  scenario. The "API is up but my data isn't in the answer" shape,
  distinct from 03's "API didn't answer at all".

  - **`scenarios/04-candles-partial.scenario.mjs`**: mocks
    REGISTRY with TWO `fakePoolBearingProposal` rows (different
    pool addresses). CANDLES returns prices ONLY for the first
    pair; the second pair is omitted from the response (the
    `makeCandlesMockHandler` filters by `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(prices, addr)`,
    so an absent address is simply not in the returned `pools`
    list — same shape as a real candles endpoint that hasn't
    indexed those pools yet). Asserts the priced card renders
    "0.4200 SDAI" while the unpriced card falls back to
    "0.00 SDAI" AND both cards remain visible.

  - **Bug-shapes guarded**:
    * One missing price corrupting all (shared cache or
      last-write-wins applies wrong price to multiple cards)
    * Card disappearing when its price is missing (overzealous
      filter hides events with null prices)
    * Formatter crashes on null prices for unpriced card while
      priced card renders fine (defensive-coding regression)
    * Prices swapping between cards (cache-key /
      address-comparison bug in `attachPrefetchedPrices`)

  - **Two slice-2 sub-slices deprioritized after investigation**:
    * **WALLET RPC failure**: the wallet stub handles
      `eth_chainId` / `eth_accounts` /
      `wallet_switchEthereumChain` LOCALLY (not via
      `rpcPassthrough`), so wagmi/RainbowKit's auto-probe
      surface doesn't actually hit `rpcUrl`. On `/companies`
      (no swap, no message-sign) the wallet's RPC URL has
      near-zero blast radius. Revisit when a scenario needs
      to drive a real swap.
    * **Mid-flight failure on /companies**: traced through
      `useAggregatorCompanies` + `CompaniesPage.jsx` —
      consumer drops the hook's `error` field, so partial-
      success on REGISTRY's three-query pipeline lands at the
      same DOM state as full failure ("No organizations found").
      Indistinguishable from scenario 02; no new bug shape
      captured. Re-evaluate on a market detail page.

  - **Validated end-to-end**: 04 passes in 1.4s; all 4
    scenarios together: 20.6s wall-clock with cold compile.
    UI-side smoke now 30 pass + 0 skip.

  - **Catalog regenerated**: `scripts/scenarios-catalog.mjs`
    re-ran cleanly, `SCENARIOS.md` now indexes 4 scenarios.

  - **Transient gotcha worth noting**: first run failed with
    "Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called
    here" — turned out to be a stale dev-server / test-results
    interaction, not a real problem with scenario 04. Killing
    port 3000 and clearing `test-results/` fixed it. Adding to
    the harness operational notes for future debugging.

- **slice 3a** (this iteration) — **CI workflow STAGED** for
  promotion to `.github/workflows/`. The harness has been usable
  locally for many iterations; slice 3a starts the path to it
  catching regressions IN CI without requiring a developer to
  manually run anything.

  - **What landed**:
    * `auto-qa/harness/ci/auto-qa-harness.yml.staged` (NEW) —
      the workflow YAML in version control under a `.staged`
      extension so GitHub Actions doesn't try to run it from
      this location.
    * `auto-qa/harness/ci/README.md` (NEW) — explains the
      staging dance + the promote command.

  - **The workflow**: trigger is `workflow_dispatch` ONLY for
    v1 (manual fire from GitHub Actions UI) — landing the
    first workflow file can't unexpectedly red-light
    unrelated PRs. Job:
    ```
    scenarios-catalog-drift:
      - actions/checkout@v4
      - actions/setup-node@v4 (Node 22, npm cache keyed on
        auto-qa/harness/package-lock.json)
      - working-directory: auto-qa/harness; npm ci
      - working-directory: auto-qa/harness; npm run scenarios:catalog
      - git diff --exit-code auto-qa/harness/scenarios/SCENARIOS.md
    ```
    Total runtime expected <1 min (no browser, no Next.js
    dev server, just the lightweight catalog regenerator + diff).

  - **Why staged not live**: GitHub blocks OAuth Apps without
    `workflow` scope from creating/modifying `.github/workflows/*`
    files. The bot's token is push-scoped only. The first
    iteration of slice 3a tried to commit the workflow directly
    and the push got rejected:
    ```
    ! [remote rejected] auto-qa -> auto-qa
    (refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update
     workflow `.github/workflows/auto-qa-harness.yml`
     without `workflow` scope)
    ```
    Recovered by:
    1. `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo the rejected commit
    2. `mv .github/workflows/auto-qa-harness.yml
        auto-qa/harness/ci/auto-qa-harness.yml.staged`
    3. `rm -rf .github` (was empty after the move)
    4. Added `auto-qa/harness/ci/README.md` documenting the
       promote command
    The staging dance puts the content under code review +
    version control without needing the workflow scope, then
    a maintainer (or anyone with the right token) promotes
    by copying the file into `.github/workflows/`.

  - **Local validation** of the workflow's logic: re-ran the
    equivalent steps manually — `npm ci` in auto-qa/harness/
    succeeded with `found 0 vulnerabilities`; `npm run
    scenarios:catalog` regenerated SCENARIOS.md cleanly;
    `git diff --exit-code` returned 0 (catalog already in sync).

  - **Drift-check value-add** (once promoted): the CI step
    ensures any PR adding/changing a scenario also re-runs the
    catalog generator. SCENARIOS.md is the human-readable
    bug-shape index; without the drift check, it silently goes
    stale.

  - **Promote command** (one-time maintainer task):
    ```bash
    mkdir -p .github/workflows
    cp auto-qa/harness/ci/auto-qa-harness.yml.staged \
       .github/workflows/auto-qa-harness.yml
    git add .github/workflows/auto-qa-harness.yml
    git commit -m "ci: promote auto-qa harness scenarios-catalog-drift"
    git push
    ```
    Pushes from a workflow-scoped token (or via the GitHub
    web UI's "Add file" action) succeed where the bot's token
    can't.

  - **Next slices in CI staging**:
    * 3b — once 3a is promoted + smoke-tested, broaden
      triggers (`schedule: '0 4 * * *'` for nightly drift
      sweep + `pull_request: paths: ['auto-qa/harness/**']`
      for harness-touching PRs). Edit the staged file, commit,
      maintainer re-promotes.
    * 3c — separate job that runs the actual Playwright
      scenarios suite (heavier; needs browser install + dev
      server)
    * 3d — `actions/upload-artifact@v4` block conditional on
      failure (Playwright traces / screenshots / videos)

- **slice 3c** (this iteration) — **second CI workflow STAGED**:
  the heavier Playwright-scenarios runner. Kept as a SEPARATE
  workflow file from slice 3a's drift check so the maintainer
  can promote each independently and gate them differently.

  - **What landed**:
    * `auto-qa/harness/ci/auto-qa-harness-scenarios.yml.staged`
      (NEW) — second workflow YAML.
    * `auto-qa/harness/ci/README.md` updated to list both staged
      files + recommended promote order.

  - **The workflow** (`auto-qa-harness-scenarios.yml`):
    ```
    scenarios-suite:
      - actions/checkout@v4
      - actions/setup-node@v4 (Node 22, npm cache on
        BOTH lockfiles — root + auto-qa/harness)
      - npm ci at root (Next.js dev server)
      - npm ci in auto-qa/harness (Playwright + viem)
      - actions/cache@v4 ~/.cache/ms-playwright keyed on
        harness lockfile hash
      - cache miss: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
        cache hit:  npx playwright install-deps chromium
      - npm run ui:full in auto-qa/harness, env
        HARNESS_FRONTEND_RPC_URL=https://rpc.gnosischain.com
    ```
    Trigger is `workflow_dispatch` ONLY for v1 (mirroring slice
    3a's conservative roll-out — second workflow file landing
    can't unexpectedly red-light unrelated PRs either). Timeout
    20 min; expected wall-clock ~5-10 min cold (~2-3 min once
    the browser cache hits).

  - **Why a SEPARATE file (not a second job in slice 3a's
    workflow)**:
    * Different cost profile: drift check <1 min vs scenarios
      suite ~5-10 min — different cadence sensible (drift could
      run on every PR; scenarios maybe nightly + manual)
    * Atomic promote-per-slice: maintainer can promote drift
      check first, smoke-test, then promote scenarios separately
    * Reduced blast radius: misconfigured scenarios YAML can't
      red-light the drift check
    * Different cache-dep paths: drift check only needs the
      harness lockfile; scenarios needs both root + harness

  - **Why `HARNESS_FRONTEND_RPC_URL=https://rpc.gnosischain.com`
    instead of localhost:8546**: there's no anvil in the GitHub
    runner. The wallet-signing eth_sendTransaction case
    auto-skips when `whichAnvil()` returns null; the other tests
    just need a working JSON-RPC endpoint for Wagmi to bootstrap
    (chain ID lookup, etc).

  - **Browser-cache pattern** (the trickiest piece): Playwright
    caches its browser binaries in `~/.cache/ms-playwright`,
    which `actions/cache@v4` can persist across runs. But the
    apt-level system deps (e.g. libnss3) aren't cached and must
    be reinstalled each run. The two-step pattern is:
    * cache miss → `playwright install --with-deps chromium`
      (binary + deps in one command)
    * cache hit → `playwright install-deps chromium`
      (apt-only, ~10-30s)
    Reduces warm-cache install time from ~60s to ~10s without
    risking missing system deps.

  - **Promote command** (one-time maintainer task on interface
    side, AFTER smoke-testing slice 3a):
    ```bash
    cp auto-qa/harness/ci/auto-qa-harness-scenarios.yml.staged \
       .github/workflows/auto-qa-harness-scenarios.yml
    git add .github/workflows/auto-qa-harness-scenarios.yml
    git commit -m "ci: promote auto-qa harness scenarios-suite"
    git push
    ```

  - **Local validation**: harness `npm ci` succeeded; `npm run
    ui:full` was last run end-to-end during slice 3a iteration
    (30 tests, all green); YAML parses cleanly via
    `python3 -c 'import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open(...))'`.

**Smoke summary (UI side, post-Phase 7 slice 3c):**

```

- **slice 3d** (this iteration) — **on-failure artifact upload
  STAGED**. Single new step appended to slice 3c's staged
  scenarios workflow (not a new file — same workflow, one more
  step). When the scenarios suite fails in CI, you NEED the
  trace/screenshots/video to debug; without this step, that
  payload would die in the runner's ephemeral filesystem.

  - **What landed**: edit to
    `auto-qa/harness/ci/auto-qa-harness-scenarios.yml.staged`
    appending one `actions/upload-artifact@v4` step after the
    `npm run ui:full` step.

  - **The step shape**:
    ```yaml
    - name: Upload Playwright artifacts on failure
      if: failure()
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: playwright-scenarios-results-${{ github.run_attempt }}
        path: |
          auto-qa/harness/playwright-report/
          auto-qa/harness/test-results/
        retention-days: 14
        if-no-files-found: ignore
    ```

  - **Why these two paths**: `playwright.config.mjs` already
    configures the on-failure capture (`trace: retain-on-failure`,
    `screenshot: only-on-failure`, `video: retain-on-failure`)
    plus the HTML report (`outputFolder: 'playwright-report'`).
    All the bot needs to do is hoist them out of the runner's
    `/__w/...` workspace before it gets torn down.

  - **Why `${{ github.run_attempt }}` in the name**: the
    Playwright config sets `retries: 2` in CI mode. Without the
    suffix, retry #2 would clobber retry #1's artifacts (or
    fail with "name already exists"). With it, you get
    `playwright-scenarios-results-1`, `-2`, `-3` for a
    fully-retried failed run — all visible in the workflow's
    Artifacts tab.

  - **Why `if-no-files-found: ignore`**: covers a corner case
    where the workflow fails BEFORE Playwright produces any
    output (e.g. `npm ci` fails). Without it, the upload step
    itself would fail, masking the real error in the run log.

  - **Why STAGED together with 3c (not as a separate file)**:
    3d is one more step in 3c's job — same workflow file, same
    runtime, same trigger. Splitting them would require a second
    promote and a second smoke-test for what's effectively a
    feature flag on 3c's debugging output. Promoted together,
    they form one coherent "run scenarios + capture failures"
    workflow.

  - **Local validation**: js-yaml parses the file cleanly
    (`npx js-yaml@4 ...`); upload-artifact step shows up at the
    right point in the parsed structure with `if: failure()`
    and the two correct paths.

  - **What's left in Phase 7 slice 3** (per CHECKLIST):
    * 3b — broaden triggers (schedule + paths gate). Gated on
      slice 3a being smoke-tested live. Bot can stage a v2 of
      the drift-check workflow but the smoke-test step is
      human.
    * Maintainer-only: 3a-promote + 3c-promote (which now
      includes 3d's step automatically).
    * Then slice 4 — full-stack docker-compose (the big one).

- **slice 4a-prep** (this iteration, on the api side) — slice 4
  (full-stack docker-compose) starts with prep work laying the
  groundwork for activating the futarchy-api service in
  `auto-qa/harness/docker-compose.yml`. The compose file has
  had an api block stubbed (commented out) since Phase 0
  slice 2; this iteration tracks the prerequisites so the block
  can be uncommented in slice 4a proper.

  - **What landed (api repo)**:
    * `Dockerfile` (NEW, tracked) — 12-line node:22-alpine
      image, runs `npm ci --omit=dev`, `EXPOSE 3031`,
      `CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]`. File was sitting
      untracked at api repo root from a prior iteration; this
      commit just tracks it.
    * `.dockerignore` (NEW, tracked) — excludes node_modules,
      .env*, test-*.js + test-*.mjs, example-test-*.js, docs,
      *.md, lambda-deploy, test-checkpoint-vs-graph-node. Same
      "untracked → tracked" story as Dockerfile.
    * `auto-qa/harness/docker-compose.yml` (modified) — api
      block's port assumptions corrected. Was: `PORT: 3000`
      env + commented `ports: - "3000:3000"`. Now:
      `PORT: 3031` (informational only) + commented
      `ports: - "3031:3031"`.

  - **Real bug surfaced**: `src/index.js:25` (api repo)
    hardcodes `const PORT = 3031` and never reads
    `process.env.PORT`. The original compose comment block
    expected `PORT: 3000` to be honored at runtime, but it
    would have been silently ignored (the api would still
    bind to 3031 inside the container, the compose's
    `ports: - "3000:3000"` would map to nothing, and a "why
    isn't the api responding?" debugging session would
    follow). Compose comment now documents the constraint
    so future contributors see it before activating the block.

  - **Why fix the compose, not src/index.js**: the cross-cutting
    acceptance gate says "Production code in `src/` (both
    repos) is NEVER modified by harness work". src/index.js
    IS production code. The harness adapts to its reality,
    not the other way around.

  - Block REMAINS COMMENTED OUT — uncommenting + verifying
    `docker compose build api` is slice 4a proper, not 4a-prep.

  - CHECKLIST slice 4 expanded: 4a-prep DONE; 4a (uncomment +
    build), 4b (indexer), 4c (interface-dev mount), 4d
    (orchestrator), 4e (full `up -d` acceptance gate) sketched.

  - Validation: `npx js-yaml@4
    auto-qa/harness/docker-compose.yml` parses cleanly; the
    named-service tree shows `anvil` as the only active service
    (api block stays a YAML comment).

- **slice 4a** (this iteration, on the api side) — the api
  block in `auto-qa/harness/docker-compose.yml` is now
  UNCOMMENTED + structurally validated. `docker compose config`
  parses cleanly with both `anvil` + `api` services active.

  - **Real bug surfaced**: the original Phase 0 scaffold had
    `context: ../../..` which resolved to `/Users/kas/` (the
    parent of the api repo, NOT the repo root). Three levels
    up from `auto-qa/harness/` is one too many — should be
    `context: ../..` (api repo root, where Dockerfile +
    package.json live). This is the SECOND port/path bug
    surfaced by activating the api service (the first being
    the PORT discovery in 4a-prep). Fixed in this slice;
    comment block above the field documents the gotcha.

  - **Why indexer dependency stays commented out**: the
    original api block had `depends_on: indexer:` but indexer
    doesn't exist in compose yet (slice 4b). With it
    uncommented, `docker compose up api` would fail with
    `service "indexer" is not defined`. Dropping the dep
    means api can start without indexer — request-time
    endpoints proxying to CHECKPOINT_URL will fail until 4b,
    but `docker compose build api` and `up api` themselves
    succeed. Re-added in slice 4b alongside the indexer
    service.

  - **Why ports comment stays commented out**:
    compose-internal traffic uses the service name
    (`api:3031` from inside the network), so host port
    mapping isn't needed for the in-network case. The
    comment block tells future contributors how to flip it
    on for local debugging.

  - **What WAS validated**: `docker compose config --quiet`
    succeeds; `docker compose config --services` returns
    `anvil` + `api`; build context resolves to
    `/Users/kas/futarchy-api` (correct).

  - **What WASN'T validated** (out of bot scope this
    iteration): the actual `docker compose build api`. The
    Docker daemon isn't running on the bot's machine
    (`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at
    unix:///Users/kas/.docker/run/docker.sock`). Pinned as
    4a-verify in CHECKLIST — small human step (start Docker
    Desktop, then `docker compose -f
    auto-qa/harness/docker-compose.yml build api`).

  - Slice 4 progress: ~17% done (4a-prep + 4a out of
    4a-prep / 4a / 4b / 4c / 4d / 4e). Next bot-doable:
    slice 4b (add Phase 3 indexer service to compose) — bigger
    lift, decisions to make about Checkpoint image source.

- **slice 4b-plan** (this iteration, on the api side) — the
  big architectural finding pre-empts implementation: the
  Phase 0 indexer stub assumed ONE service `indexer` with
  `image: TODO`. Reality, per ADR-002 + Phase 3
  implementation, is TWO indexers (registry + candles), each
  with its own postgres, each built from the sibling
  `futarchy-indexers` clone. The Phase 0 stub also used
  `CHECKPOINT_URL` as the api env var, but
  `src/config/endpoints.js` actually reads `REGISTRY_URL` +
  `CANDLES_URL` (third path/port bug surfaced by working
  through compose).

  - **What landed (api side)**:
    * `auto-qa/harness/docs/ADR-002-indexer-bootstrap.md` —
      Status: Proposed → Accepted. Added a 2026-05 revisit
      note explaining how the decision held up through
      Phase 3 and what slice 4b-include/network-wire will do
      for Phase 7.
    * `auto-qa/harness/docker-compose.yml` — Phase 0 indexer
      stub block (`image: TODO` single-service one) rewritten
      to point at ADR-002 and explain the four real services
      (registry-checkpoint + registry-postgres + candles-
      checkpoint + candles-postgres). New top-level `include:`
      block staged COMMENTED OUT, referencing both sibling
      indexer compose files.
    * `auto-qa/harness/CHECKLIST.md` — slice 4b expanded into
      5 sub-slices: 4b-plan (DONE), 4b-include, 4b-network-
      wire, 4b-api-env, 4b-verify.

  - **Why staged not active**: uncommenting `include:` brings
    in the four indexer services AND their networks (registry-
    net, candles-net) AND defaults RPC_URL to real Gnosis.
    Without the network bridging + env override done
    atomically, the indexers would either fail to reach anvil
    OR happily ingest from real Gnosis (defeating the harness
    purpose). 4b-include + 4b-network-wire are sequential, not
    parallel. 4b-plan stages the structure so the next two
    slices have a clear target.

  - **Why ADR-002 wasn't already Accepted**: the ADR was
    written during Phase 3 slice 1 with status "Proposed
    (Phase 3 slice 1)" assuming a future review session.
    That review never happened, but the implementation went
    ahead and has 25 smoke tests behind it. Slice 4b-plan
    retroactively closes the loop.

  - **Validation**: `docker compose config --quiet` succeeds;
    `--services` still returns just `anvil` + `api` (the
    include block is a YAML comment, no runtime delta).

  - Slice 4 progress: ~25% done (4a-prep + 4a + 4b-plan out of
    ~12 sub-slices total — slice 4b alone now decomposes into
    5). Next bot-doable: 4b-include (uncomment include block +
    add cross-network bridging) AND/OR 4b-network-wire
    (RPC_URL override).

- **slice 4b-include + 4b-api-env** (this iteration, on the
  api side) — uncommented the top-level `include:` block;
  `docker compose config --services` now returns 6 services
  (anvil + api + 4 indexer services). Also corrected the api
  service env from the wrong Phase 0 `CHECKPOINT_URL` to the
  real `REGISTRY_URL` + `CANDLES_URL` + `FUTARCHY_MODE` env
  vars per `src/config/endpoints.js`.

  - **Service-name reality vs Phase 0 stub assumptions**:
    registry compose uses `registry-checkpoint` +
    `registry-postgres` (prefixed); candles compose uses bare
    `checkpoint` + `postgres` (NOT `candles-checkpoint` /
    `candles-postgres` as the Phase 0 stub assumed). The
    container_names ARE prefixed
    (`futarchy-candles-checkpoint-1`) but the service names
    aren't. Also: candles uses `GNOSIS_RPC_URL`, registry
    uses `RPC_URL` — different env contracts.

  - **Why depends_on on indexers NOT added yet**: the indexers
    and api are on different networks (registry-net /
    checkpoint-net vs harness-net), so the api can't actually
    reach them via compose-internal name resolution yet.
    Adding the depends_on would have compose wait forever for
    cross-network healthchecks. Slice 4b-network-wire fixes
    this; only then can the depends_on be added.

  - **4b-network-wire BLOCKED**: naive override attempt
    failed. Tried declaring same-name service blocks
    (`registry-checkpoint:`, `checkpoint:`) in the parent
    compose to extend the included services with `networks:
    [registry-net, harness-net]` + RPC env override. Compose
    rejected: `services.registry-checkpoint conflicts with
    imported resource`. Compose v2.34's `include:` does NOT
    allow same-name service redefinition in the parent file.
    Three alternatives surfaced + documented:
    (a) Override-list form: `include: - path: [base.yml,
        overrides.yml]`. Compose merges base + overrides
        BEFORE include.
    (b) Per-service `extends:` (drop `include:`). Each
        indexer service declared here with `extends: { file:
        ..., service: ... }` plus harness overrides. Closest
        fit for ADR-002's wrapper leg.
    (c) Multi-file `docker compose -f base.yml -f
        overrides.yml`. Rejected: breaks the single-compose
        acceptance gate.
    Decision deferred to slice 4b-network-wire next
    iteration; approach (b) is the lead candidate.

  - **What was learned**: compose v2's `include:` is for
    IMPORTING, not OVERRIDING. The conflict error is
    structurally equivalent to a TypeScript "duplicate
    identifier" — there's no compose-level "override modifier"
    for included services.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~33% done (4a-prep + 4a + 4b-plan +
    4b-include + 4b-api-env / ~12 sub-slices). Next:
    4b-network-wire approach (b).

- **slice 4b-network-wire** (this iteration, on the api side)
  — indexers wired into the harness compose via per-service
  `extends:` (approach b from prior iteration's options list,
  ADR-002's "wrapper" leg).

  - **What changed in compose**:
    * `include:` block REMOVED (it rejected same-name overrides)
    * Top-level `networks:` expanded with `registry-net` +
      `checkpoint-net`
    * Top-level `volumes:` declared with
      `registry-postgres-data` + `candles-postgres-data`
    * 4 new service blocks: `registry-checkpoint`,
      `registry-postgres`, `checkpoint`, `postgres` — each
      uses `extends: { file:
      ../../../futarchy-indexers/.../docker-compose.yml,
      service: <bare name> }` to pull in the indexer's full
      definition
    * Two checkpoint services get harness overrides:
      RPC_URL / GNOSIS_RPC_URL = http://anvil:8545; RESET=true;
      networks dual-homed; depends_on anvil + their postgres
    * api depends_on now safely declares registry-checkpoint
      + checkpoint (service_started since indexers have no
      healthcheck)

  - **Compose extends merge confirmed via test**:
    * Maps merge (env override layered on included defaults)
    * Sequences replace (must repeat original network)
    * Build context resolves to extended file's directory
      (registry → /Users/kas/futarchy-indexers/futarchy-complete/checkpoint;
      candles → /Users/kas/futarchy-indexers/proposals-candles/checkpoint)

  - **Validation**: `docker compose config --quiet` succeeds;
    `--services` returns 6; merged config shows
    RPC_URL=http://anvil:8545 on registry, GNOSIS_RPC_URL on
    candles, api depends_on lists all three.

  - **Pinned for slice 4b-verify** (Docker daemon required,
    mostly human work): actual `docker compose up -d`; indexers
    can reach anvil over harness-net; api can resolve
    registry-checkpoint:3000 + checkpoint:3000 GraphQL;
    postgres healthchecks.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~42% done (6 of ~12 sub-slices). Next:
    slice 4b-verify (daemon smoke) OR slice 4c (interface-dev
    block in compose).

- **slice 4c-prep** (this iteration, on the api side) — fixed
  FIVE bugs in the Phase 0 `interface-dev` stub. Same pattern
  as slice 4a-prep: stub couldn't be activated as-is; prep
  fixes the stub in place (still commented) so 4c-activate
  becomes a one-step uncomment.

  - **Bug catalog** (interface-dev block):

    (i) **Path bug**: stub had
        `${INTERFACE_PATH:-../../../../interface}`. From
        `auto-qa/harness/`, four levels up = `/`. Bind mount
        would have failed at compose-up. Corrected to
        `../../../interface` (= /Users/kas/interface). Same
        "one too many ..s" issue as slice 4a's
        `context: ../../..` bug.

    (ii) **Port bug**: stub had `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:
        http://api:3000`. Api binds to 3031 (slice 4a-prep
        finding). Corrected to `http://api:3031`.

    (iii) **Missing anvil dep**: stub only had `depends_on:
        api`. But Wagmi reads NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL →
        http://anvil:8545; needs anvil reachable too.
        Added `depends_on: anvil` alongside the api dep.

    (iv) **Bare `npm run dev` won't work in fresh container**:
        bind mount has source but no node_modules. Replaced
        with `sh -c` script: conditional `npm install` if
        node_modules empty, then
        `exec npx next dev --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 3000`.
        The `--hostname 0.0.0.0` is critical — `next dev`
        defaults to localhost-only binding which isn't
        reachable from outside the container.

    (v) **Node version mismatch**: stub had
        `image: node:20-bookworm-slim`. Harness convention
        is node 22. Standardized on `node:22-alpine`.

  - **Top-level addition**: `interface-node-modules` named
    volume to keep container's Linux node_modules separate
    from host's macOS-binary tree.

  - **Why STAGED not active**: Next.js dev-in-container has
    known caveats (file-watching across bind mounts can be
    unreliable; HMR over docker network has quirks; first-
    run npm install of ~1000+ deps takes minutes). Worth a
    careful 4c-verify smoke after activation.

  - **Validation**: `docker compose config --quiet` succeeds;
    `--services` still returns 6 (interface-dev remains a
    YAML comment). Top-level `interface-node-modules` volume
    declared eagerly so 4c-activate is purely a service-block
    uncomment.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~50% done (7 of ~12+ sub-slices —
    slice 4c now decomposes into 4c-prep + 4c-activate +
    potentially 4c-verify). Next: 4c-activate (one-step
    uncomment) OR return to 4b-verify (daemon-required
    smoke).

- **slice 4c-activate** (this iteration, on the api side) —
  the interface-dev block is UNCOMMENTED.
  `docker compose config --services` returns 7. Atomic
  one-step uncomment per slice 4c-prep; no edits to the
  block itself.

  - **Merged config verified via `docker compose config`**:
    depends_on (anvil healthy + api started); env
    (NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://anvil:8545,
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://api:3031); image
    (node:22-alpine); command (sh -c conditional npm install
    + `exec npx next dev --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 3000`);
    bind mount of `${INTERFACE_PATH:-../../../interface}` +
    named volume `interface-node-modules` for Linux-isolated
    node_modules.

  - **What's still pending in slice 4**:
    * 4c-verify (Docker daemon required, mostly human):
      bring up the stack and curl http://localhost:3010 to
      confirm next dev is reachable. CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true
      if HMR doesn't fire on host edits.
    * 4d (orchestrator service): the Phase 0 stub has the
      same kinds of bugs as 4c's stub, AND a deeper scope
      issue — ARCHITECTURE.md envisions an orchestrator that
      drives anvil's clock + sends txs + runs cross-layer
      assertions, but the assertion scripts (orchestrator/
      invariants.mjs) don't exist yet. Slice 4d will need
      both compose wiring AND scenario script development.
    * 4e (`docker compose up -d` acceptance gate): trivial
      after 4c-verify + 4d.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~58% done (8 of ~13+ sub-slices total).

- **slice 4d-prep** (this iteration, on the api side) — fixed
  FIVE bugs in the Phase 0 orchestrator stub + decomposed
  slice 4d into 3 sub-slices (the original "orchestrator
  service" was a single line in CHECKLIST; reality is bigger).

  - **Bug catalog**:
    (i) Path bug: `../../../auto-qa/harness` resolves to
        `/Users/kas/auto-qa/harness/` (doesn't exist);
        corrected to `.` (the harness dir IS the compose
        file's directory).
    (ii) Port bug: `API_URL: http://api:3000` → 3031.
    (iii) Wrong env vars: `CHECKPOINT_URL: http://indexer:3001/graphql`
        → `REGISTRY_URL: http://registry-checkpoint:3000/graphql`
        + `CANDLES_URL: http://checkpoint:3000/graphql`
        (per src/config/endpoints.js).
    (iv) Node version: 20-bookworm → 22-alpine.
    (v) `npm run test` won't work in fresh container;
        replaced with conditional install + exec pattern.

  - **Top-level addition**: `orchestrator-node-modules`
    named volume.

  - **DEEPER SCOPE FINDING**: ARCHITECTURE.md envisions
    orchestrator/invariants.mjs (cross-layer assertion lib)
    + scenario-runner. NEITHER EXISTS YET. The existing
    orchestrator/services.mjs assumes native-anvil + script
    indexers (Phase 3 topology) — would conflict with the
    compose stack. Slice 4d split into 4d-prep (this),
    4d-scenarios (build invariants.mjs + decide between
    HARNESS_COMPOSE-gated unified runner vs defer compose
    orchestrator), 4d-activate (atomic uncomment after
    4d-scenarios).

  - **Why command is `tail -f /dev/null`**: even with bugs
    fixed, orchestrator container needs SOME command. No-op
    placeholder lets it start cleanly without doing anything
    until 4d-scenarios builds the real runner.

  - **Validation**: `docker compose config --quiet` succeeds;
    `--services` still returns 7 (orchestrator block remains
    commented).

  - Slice 4 progress: ~62% done (9 of ~14+ sub-slices total —
    slice 4d now decomposes into 3). Next bot-doable: slice
    4d-scenarios (NEW CODE — build the assertion library) OR
    slice 4e (acceptance gate, blocked on 4b-verify +
    4c-verify + 4d-activate).

- **slice 4d-scenarios (scaffold)** (this iteration, on the
  api side) — the FIRST meaningful new code in slice 4 (not
  just compose wiring or stub fixes). Picked path (a): a
  HARNESS_COMPOSE=1-gated unified runner. Same binary works
  in compose mode (hits already-running endpoints) and
  eventually in native mode (will delegate to services.mjs).

  - **What landed (api side)**:
    * `auto-qa/harness/orchestrator/invariants.mjs` — the
      assertion library. Exports `INVARIANTS` array and
      `runAllInvariants(ctx)` aggregator. First 2 invariants:
      `apiHealth` (api/health 200) and `apiCanReachRegistry`
      (api/registry/graphql proxies __typename probe).
      Aggregator runs all checks without short-circuiting so
      one broken layer doesn't hide downstream failures.
    * `auto-qa/harness/orchestrator/scenario-runner.mjs` —
      CLI entry point. Reads service URLs from env
      (API_URL, REGISTRY_URL, CANDLES_URL, RPC_URL); gates
      on HARNESS_COMPOSE=1; supports HARNESS_DRY_RUN=1 for
      offline catalog dump; exits 2 in native mode with a
      pointer to start-indexers.mjs + tests/.
    * `auto-qa/harness/tests/smoke-scenario-runner.test.mjs`
      — 6 tests against an in-process node:http fixture
      mimicking api response shapes. INVARIANTS shape;
      happy path; 2 failure paths (verifying no
      short-circuit); CLI dry-run; CLI native-mode
      rejection. All 6 green.
    * `auto-qa/harness/package.json` — 3 new scripts:
      `scenarios:dry`, `scenarios:run`, `smoke:scenarios`.

  - **What this enables**:
    * Slice 4d-activate: replace the placeholder
      `tail -f /dev/null` command in the orchestrator
      compose block with `npm run scenarios:run`. Atomic
      uncomment now that the runner exists.
    * Future iterations ADD invariants to the array
      without touching scenario-runner.mjs — clean
      separation between assertion library (data) and
      runner (control flow).

  - **Validation**:
    * `npm run smoke:scenarios` → 6/6 pass (155ms)
    * `npm run scenarios:dry` → exits 0; prints catalog
    * Native-mode rejection prints clear pointer + exits 2

  - Slice 4 progress: ~67% done (10 of ~15+ sub-slices —
    4d-scenarios decomposes further into per-invariant
    sub-slices over time). Next bot-doable: slice
    4d-activate (atomic uncomment + replace placeholder
    command) OR 4d-scenarios-more (next invariant —
    apiCanReachCandles, mirroring the registry pattern).

- **slice 4d-activate** (this iteration, on the api side) —
  the orchestrator block is UNCOMMENTED. The placeholder
  `tail -f /dev/null` (kept through 4d-prep so the service
  could exist structurally before the runner did) is replaced
  with the real entry point: `node
  orchestrator/scenario-runner.mjs`.

  - **`docker compose config --services` returns 8** — the
    full stack is now structurally complete: anvil, api,
    registry-checkpoint, registry-postgres, checkpoint,
    postgres, interface-dev, orchestrator.

  - **Lifecycle**: orchestrator is one-shot. Container starts
    → runs every invariant → exits 0 (all-pass) or 1
    (any-fail). Other services keep running so you can
    re-run with `docker compose run --rm orchestrator`
    without bringing the stack down. Matches the eventual
    CI workflow pattern (workflow checks orchestrator's
    exit code).

  - **Simplified vs prep**: the prep slice staged a
    conditional `npm install` in the command. Unnecessary —
    harness has zero deps; scenario-runner only uses Node 22
    builtins. Replaced multi-line `sh -c` with clean
    `["node", "orchestrator/scenario-runner.mjs"]`.
    `orchestrator-node-modules` named volume kept (currently
    empty) for future invariants that need viem etc.

  - **What's left for slice 4 acceptance gate (4e)**:
    * 4b-verify, 4c-verify, 4d-verify (Docker daemon
      required, mostly human): bring up subsets of the
      stack, verify each layer talks to the next.
    * 4e (acceptance gate): single `docker compose up -d`
      works on a fresh checkout. Trivial after the verifies.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~73% done (11 of ~15+ sub-slices). All
    bot-doable structural work in slice 4 is now complete
    except slice 4d-scenarios-more (incremental: add more
    invariants). Remaining sub-slices need Docker daemon
    and are mostly human work.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (apiCanReachCandles)** (this
  iteration, on the api side) — one new invariant added.
  Mirrors the registry-probe pattern: POST `__typename` query
  to api `/candles/graphql`, assert
  `data.__typename === 'Query'`. Trace: api endpoint →
  proxyCandlesQuery → candles-adapter → upstream Checkpoint
  indexer. The bare `__typename` flows through cleanly
  (doesn't trigger any of the adapter's schema-translation
  branches).

  - **Demonstrates the additive pattern** that slice
    4d-scenarios established: new invariants are pure-
    additive edits to the INVARIANTS array. Zero changes
    to scenario-runner.mjs. Each new invariant ships with
    smoke-test coverage.

  - **Validation**: 7/7 smoke tests pass (147ms);
    `npm run scenarios:dry` lists all 3 invariants;
    `docker compose config --quiet` still passes.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~75% (12 of ~16+ sub-slices). Next
    bot-doable: another invariant — rateSanity (needs RPC
    + ABI; meatier) OR registryDirect/candlesDirect (probe
    indexers without going through api — validates the
    network bridging from slice 4b-network-wire is correct
    end-to-end).

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (registryDirect + candlesDirect)**
  (this iteration, on the api side) — TWO new invariants in
  one iteration; small, symmetrical, naturally paired.

  - **What they do**: probe the indexer GraphQL endpoints
    directly (`ctx.registryUrl`, `ctx.candlesUrl`) without
    going through the api passthrough. Validates that the
    orchestrator container can reach the indexers over
    harness-net.

  - **Why pair them with the api-passthrough invariants**:
    if api↔registry passes but registryDirect fails (or
    vice versa), it's a useful debug signal — the api is
    reaching the indexer by some route the orchestrator
    can't (DNS cache, connection pool, cached response).
    Compose stack expects both routes to work.

  - **Validates slice 4b-network-wire end-to-end** (or
    will, once daemon-required smoke is human-run): the
    orchestrator container is single-homed on harness-net,
    indexers are dual-homed (registry-net + harness-net via
    per-service `extends:` blocks). These two invariants
    are the first to EXERCISE the bridging from the
    orchestrator's vantage point.

  - **What landed**:
    * `orchestrator/invariants.mjs` — added registryDirect
      + candlesDirect after apiCanReachCandles; both use
      the now-stable invariant shape; both probe
      `ctx.registryUrl` / `ctx.candlesUrl` directly.
    * `tests/smoke-scenario-runner.test.mjs` — fixture
      extended with `/registry-direct/graphql` +
      `/candles-direct/graphql` paths (distinguished from
      api-passthrough versions); new `fullCtx(fxUrl)`
      helper bundles all the URLs cleanly; 2 new
      failure-path tests verify direct-probe failures
      don't short-circuit api-passthrough ones; CLI
      dry-run test extended to assert all 5 invariants
      appear in stdout.

  - **Validation**: 9/9 smoke tests pass (167ms);
    `npm run scenarios:dry` lists all 5 invariants;
    `docker compose config --quiet` still passes.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~80% (13 of ~16+ sub-slices) —
    4d-scenarios-more is roughly half-way through the
    planned per-invariant additions.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (rateSanity)** (this iteration,
  on the api side) — first chain-layer invariant. Up to now
  all 5 invariants probed HTTP layers (api or indexer
  GraphQL); this one issues a raw JSON-RPC `eth_call` to
  the sDAI contract on Gnosis and asserts the result is
  sane.

  - **What it does**: eth_call to sDAI
    (0x89C80A4540A00b5270347E02e2E144c71da2EceD) with
    `getRate()` selector (0x679aefce); parses uint256 via
    BigInt; asserts ≥ 10n ** 18n (rate ≥ 1.0). Mirrors
    `src/services/rate-provider.js` (same address +
    selector + parse).

  - **Why ≥ 1.0**: sDAI is ERC-4626; rate at launch was
    1.0 and grows over time as savings accrue. A rate < 1
    implies broken contract / corrupt fork / wrong
    contract address.

  - **Future enhancement**: cross-run monotonicity (needs
    persistent state — orchestrator is one-shot, so within
    a run monotonicity is trivially "≥ 1 sample").

  - **What was added**:
    * Constants: SDAI_GNOSIS_ADDRESS, GET_RATE_SELECTOR,
      ONE_E18 (BigInt literal 10n ** 18n)
    * Helper: ethCall(rpcUrl, to, data, timeoutMs)
    * The invariant itself (orchestrator↔chain layer)
    * Fixture extended with /rpc POST handler + sDAIRateRaw
      / rpcError options; fullCtx() helper sets rpcUrl
    * 3 new test cases (happy 1.2, fail < 1.0, RPC error)

  - **Validation**: 12/12 smoke tests pass (171ms — was
    9/9); `npm run scenarios:dry` lists all 6 invariants;
    `docker compose config --quiet` still passes.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~83% (14 of ~17 sub-slices). Next
    bot-doable: probabilityBounds (price ∈ [0, 1]) or
    candlesAggregation or chartShape — meaningful new
    invariants on the now-stable RPC + GraphQL plumbing.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (anvilBlockNumber + anvilChainId)**
  (this iteration, on the api side) — two new chain-process
  probes complement `rateSanity` (contract STATE) with chain-
  PROCESS health checks. Naturally paired:
  * `anvilBlockNumber` — eth_blockNumber > 0 (chain has
    state, fork loaded a real starting point)
  * `anvilChainId` — eth_chainId == 0x64 (chain 100 =
    Gnosis; catches "fork wrong chain" + "running bare
    anvil at default 31337")

  - **Why split into 3 chain-layer invariants**: separation
    of concerns lets failures point at the right layer.
    BlockNumber=0 means anvil isn't producing blocks /
    fork didn't load. ChainId mismatch means forking the
    wrong chain. Rate < 1 means chain is alive but
    contract state isn't right. Each failure mode is a
    different bug; bundling would obscure which fired.

  - **Refactor of fixture's /rpc handler**: was
    eth_call-only (returned rate-shaped response for any
    method). Now parses the request body, branches on
    method, returns method-appropriate responses (eth_call
    → rate hex, eth_blockNumber → blockNumberHex,
    eth_chainId → chainIdHex; method-not-mocked +
    JSON-parse-error fallbacks). Two new options:
    blockNumberHex / chainIdHex.

  - **Refactor of invariants.mjs**: introduced
    `rpcRequest(rpcUrl, method, params)` as the generic
    JSON-RPC helper. ethCall(...) now delegates to it.
    Both new invariants use rpcRequest directly with
    method name + empty params.

  - **Smoke test coverage**: 4 new tests (happy + failure
    for each new invariant). All 16 tests pass (was 12).

  - **Validation**: 16/16 smoke tests pass (199ms);
    `npm run scenarios:dry` lists all 8 invariants;
    `docker compose config --quiet` still passes.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~88% (15 of ~17 sub-slices).
    4d-scenarios-more is now well past half-way. Remaining
    bot-doable invariants (probabilityBounds,
    candlesAggregation, chartShape, conservation) all need
    real pool data or multiple contract calls — meatier
    than the simple GraphQL/RPC probes shipped so far.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (apiWarmer + apiSpotCandlesValidates)**
  (this iteration, on the api side) — two new api-internal
  invariants cover the previously-unmonitored `/warmer`
  endpoint and add a validation-regression check that
  doesn't need real data:
  * `apiWarmer` — GET `/warmer`, assert 200 + JSON. Doesn't
    peek at body shape (over-coupling would make it fragile).
  * `apiSpotCandlesValidates` — GET `/api/v1/spot-candles`
    WITHOUT ticker, assert 400 + JSON `{error: ...}`.
    Catches three failure modes in one check: validation
    removed (200 with garbage), validation crashes (5xx),
    route disconnected (404).

  - **Why these two**: existing 8 invariants covered one
    api endpoint (/health), 2 GraphQL passthroughs, 2
    direct-indexer probes, 3 chain-layer RPC. They don't
    exercise other api endpoints OR input-validation paths.
    This slice picks off two — the warmer endpoint
    (lowest-risk: pure liveness) and the validation
    behavior (interesting bug class: 400→200 silently
    breaks downstream consumers).

  - **Smoke fixture extensions**: `/warmer` + 
    `/api/v1/spot-candles` GET routes added with toggles
    (`warmerOk`, `warmerContentType`,
    `spotCandlesNoTickerStatus`, `spotCandlesNoTickerBody`).

  - **Smoke test coverage**: 5 new tests (happy + failures
    for each); 21/21 pass (was 16). Now 10 invariants in
    catalog.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~88% (16 of ~18 sub-slices —
    4d-scenarios-more keeps absorbing one or two
    invariants per iteration). The api-internal/RPC/GraphQL
    layers are now well covered (10 invariants); meaningful
    next additions step into data-shape validation (real
    pool data, cross-layer reconciliation).

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (registryHasProposalEntities +
  candlesHasPools)** (this iteration, on the api side) —
  first DATA-AWARE indexer probes, one level deeper than
  the bare `__typename` checks:
  * `registryHasProposalEntities` — query
    `{ proposalEntities(first: 1) { id } }`, assert array
    non-empty
  * `candlesHasPools` — query `{ pools(first: 1) { id } }`,
    same shape

  - **Bug class caught**: "indexer reachable but empty".
    Concrete failure modes: sync didn't complete; fork
    started after all proposal/pool deployment events;
    schema-migration cold-start failure (per Phase 3
    effort notes).

  - **Schema reality verification** (worth pinning):
    Registry has Aggregator/Organization/ProposalEntity/
    MetadataEntry types — auto-gen plurals make the field
    `proposalEntities` (NOT `proposals`). Candles has
    WhitelistedToken/Proposal/Pool/Candle/Swap → the
    naming collision (registry's `ProposalEntity` vs
    candles' `Proposal`) is real: registry tracks
    proposal METADATA, candles tracks the AMM-pool
    wrapper for conditional tokens.

  - **Fixture extension**: existing direct endpoints now
    return SUPERSET response (both `__typename` and the
    relevant data array) so each invariant just looks at
    its specific field; no GraphQL parsing in the fixture.
    Two new options:
    `registryProposalEntitiesCount`, `candlesPoolsCount`.

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy + empty for each); 25/25
    pass (was 21). 12 invariants total now: 5 api-internal
    + 4 indexer + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~89% (17 of ~19 sub-slices). Each
    iteration is now 1-2 invariants; the slice keeps
    expanding as new bug classes surface.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (candlesHasSwaps + candlesHasCandles)**
  (this iteration, on the api side) — completes the
  candles-pipeline triplet alongside `candlesHasPools`. Each
  catches a DISTINCT stage of sync:
  * `candlesHasPools` (existing) — pool-deployment events
  * `candlesHasSwaps` (new) — per-trade Swap events
  * `candlesHasCandles` (new) — period-aggregator output

  - **Why these matter as a triplet**: each represents a
    different async failure mode. Pool exists w/o swaps =
    no trades or sync caught up to deployment but not past;
    swaps exist w/o candles = aggregator broken or behind.
    Together the triplet fingerprints which stage is
    unhealthy — better than a single "candles indexer
    empty" check.

  - **Concrete bug classes distinguished**:
    * Indexer not started → all 3 fail
    * Caught up to pool deployment but not past → pools=ok,
      swaps+candles=fail
    * Trades arriving but Checkpoint @aggregate job dead →
      pools+swaps=ok, candles=fail (real bug; aggregate
      jobs can silently die)

  - **Fixture extension**: candles-direct response now
    returns pools + swaps + candles arrays in one superset
    payload. Two new options: candlesSwapsCount,
    candlesCandlesCount.

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy + cross-stage failure
    modes); 29/29 pass (was 25). Now 14 invariants: 5
    api-internal + 6 indexer + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~89% (18 of ~20 sub-slices —
    4d-scenarios-more keeps expanding the invariant set).
    Next bot-doable: candlesAggregation (cross-layer
    reconciliation, the natural next step after the
    per-stage probes), chartShape, probabilityBounds,
    conservation, cross-run rateSanity monotonicity.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (registryHasOrganizations +
  registryHasAggregators)** (this iteration, on the api
  side) — completes the registry-entity triplet alongside
  `registryHasProposalEntities`, mirroring the structural
  symmetry of the candles-pipeline triplet:
  * `registryHasProposalEntities` (existing) — proposal
    metadata indexed
  * `registryHasOrganizations` (new) — organization
    metadata indexed
  * `registryHasAggregators` (new) — root-tree entity
    indexed

  - **Why these matter**: the registry schema has 3
    hierarchically-nested entity types (Aggregator →
    Organization → ProposalEntity), each populated from a
    separate event handler. Each can independently fail to
    sync. Concrete bug classes:
    * Aggregator handler broken → no orgs/proposals can
      resolve their parent (api joins fail silently)
    * Organization handler broken → proposals exist but
      lack org-level metadata
    * ProposalEntity handler broken → no proposals visible

  - **Production hint pinned**: `registryHasAggregators`'s
    body comment notes futarchy.fi production has exactly
    one Aggregator at
    `0xc5eb43d53e2fe5fdde5faf400cc4167e5b5d4fc1` (per
    src/routes/unified-chart.js); harness fork inherits it.

  - **Symmetry with candles**: harness now has full
    data-aware coverage of BOTH indexers' schema-discoverable
    entities. 6 data-aware indexer invariants total (3 per
    indexer, mirroring each other structurally).

  - **Fixture extension**: registry-direct response now
    returns proposalEntities + organizations + aggregators
    in superset payload. Two new options:
    registryOrganizationsCount, registryAggregatorsCount.

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy + cross-entity failure
    modes); 33/33 pass (was 29). Now 16 invariants: 5
    api-internal + 8 indexer + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~90% (19 of ~21 sub-slices). Both
    indexers now have full data-aware triplet coverage
    (3 entities each). Next bot-doable invariants are
    cross-layer reconciliations (candlesAggregation,
    chartShape, probabilityBounds, conservation) — meatier
    than the additive per-entity probes.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (candleOHLCOrdering +
  candleVolumesNonNegative)** (this iteration, on the api
  side) — first DATA-SHAPE invariants. Up to now all 16
  indexer invariants checked existence (does the row
  exist?). These two check VALUES (does the row's content
  make sense?). Both query the latest candle:
  * `candleOHLCOrdering` — `low ≤ open, close ≤ high`
    (and `low ≤ high`)
  * `candleVolumesNonNegative` — `volumeToken0 ≥ 0` AND
    `volumeToken1 ≥ 0`

  - **Bug classes caught**:
    * OHLC failure: aggregator min/max accumulator broken
      (signedness error, swap-direction misclassification,
      uninitialized-min-equals-max edge case). `high < low`
      is impossible by definition; `close > high` means the
      close-of-period update path missed a max() call.
    * Volume failure: signed-amount bug — probably
      subtracting outgoing from incoming when it should
      take Math.abs(). Negative volumes nonsensical.

  - **Vacuously true when no candles**: both return ok if
    candles[] is empty. That's candlesHasCandles's concern,
    not these. Cleanly separates "no data" from "data is
    wrong" — important during compose startup.

  - **Schema details pinned**: open/high/low/close/
    volumeToken0/volumeToken1 all `String!` per
    `futarchy-indexers/proposals-candles/checkpoint/src/schema.gql`.
    parseFloat() tolerates either decimal or scientific.

  - **Fixture extension**: 6 new options for the 6 latest-
    candle fields. The first candle row in the response
    array carries the OHLC + volume fields; subsequent
    rows just have id.

  - **Smoke tests**: 6 new (happy + 5 specific failure
    modes); 39/39 pass (was 33). Now 18 invariants: 5
    api-internal + 10 indexer + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~90% (20 of ~22 sub-slices). The
    harness now has 18 invariants distinguishing many
    distinct failure modes — existence vs shape vs
    cross-layer reconciliation. Remaining: cross-layer
    reconciliations + cross-run monotonicity.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (apiUnifiedChartShape)**
  (this iteration, on the api side) — second api
  data-PLANE check, paired with last iteration's
  apiSpotCandlesHappyPath:
  * `apiUnifiedChartShape` — calls
    `/api/v2/proposals/harness-probe-proposal/chart`,
    asserts 200 + JSON content-type + body has
    `candles.{yes, no, spot}` all arrays.

  - **Both api data-plane probes follow the same
    template but exercise dramatically different code
    paths**:
    * apiSpotCandlesHappyPath: light path (validate
      ticker → fetchSpotCandles → spotCache →
      transform). 1 indexer touch.
    * apiUnifiedChartShape: heavy path (proposal
      resolve via registry → pool fetch via candles →
      currency rate via chain → parallel YES/NO/SPOT
      candle fetch → response transform with
      applyRateToCandles). 3 layer touches.

  - **Why this is high-value coverage**: unified-
    chart is the single API consumed by every
    proposal page in the futarchy.fi UI. Yes/no/spot
    price history all goes through it. A regression
    in any of resolve, pool-fetch, rate-lookup, or
    response-transform breaks the primary user-
    visible chart. The shape probe catches the WHOLE
    "endpoint up but data plane broken" class with
    a single check.

  - **Bug shapes caught (distinct from
    apiSpotCandlesHappyPath)**:
    * Proposal resolve returns null pools → yes/no
      arrays missing → frontend crashes destructuring
    * applyRateToCandles regression returns wrong
      shape (Promise instead of array)
    * Refactor that renames `spot` to `spotCandles`
      (the field name diverged once already with
      the sister endpoint — easy to confuse)
    * Cache layer returns stale/wrong-shape (X-Cache:
      HIT path differs from MISS path)

  - **First step toward documented chartShape
    invariant**: PROGRESS.md's cross-layer invariants
    table calls for `api /v2/.../chart vs indexer raw`
    match. This iteration ships the shape half;
    future iteration adds cross-check (api candle
    counts vs candles.{yes,no} direct queries) by
    reusing the cross-layer match template.

  - **Fixture extension**: route `/api/v2/proposals/
    <id>/chart` (regex match because proposalId is a
    path param) returns 200 + minimal-shape body by
    default; new unifiedChartStatus / unifiedChartBody
    knobs for drift simulation.

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy-empty, happy-with-
    data, data-plane error / 500 — verifies apiHealth
    STILL passes distinguishing endpoint-broken from
    api-down, missing yes array / refactor that drops
    a side); 89/89 pass (was 85). Now 31 invariants:
    7 api-internal + 21 indexer + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: 2-of-3 documented /api/v*
    endpoints now have happy-path data-plane coverage.
    Cross-layer invariants table from PROGRESS.md is
    now ~50% covered.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (apiSpotCandlesHappyPath)**
  (previous iteration, on the api side) — first api
  data-PLANE check in the catalog:
  * `apiSpotCandlesHappyPath` — calls
    `/api/v1/spot-candles?ticker=harness-probe-ticker`,
    asserts 200 + JSON content-type + body has
    `spotCandles` array.

  - **Why this is a distinct coverage class**: all
    prior api-side invariants probed liveness
    (apiHealth, apiWarmer), validation paths
    (apiSpotCandlesValidates — 400 branch only),
    raw passthroughs (apiCanReachRegistry/Candles),
    or cross-layer match (apiCandlesMatchesDirect /
    apiRegistryMatchesDirect). NONE exercised the
    api's full data plane: request → validation →
    downstream call → response transform → JSON write.
    This closes that gap.

  - **Bug shapes caught (distinct from the 400-path
    probe)**:
    * Validation passes but downstream throws → 500
      (the 400-path probe keeps passing because it
      tests a different request)
    * Response transform regression — code returns
      raw spotData instead of `{spotCandles: …}`,
      OR field renamed/dropped
    * Status-code regression — endpoint silently
      returns 204/202

  - **Empty-array semantics**: `spotCandles: []` is
    the documented happy-path empty case (api wraps
    in `{spotCandles: []}` even when upstream returns
    nothing). So `length === 0` is PASSING, not
    vacuous.

  - **Fixture extension**: /api/v1/spot-candles
    handler now dispatches on `?ticker=` presence;
    new spotCandlesWithTickerStatus / Body knobs for
    drift simulation. URL match relaxed from `===`
    to `startsWith` to handle the query string.

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy-empty, happy-with-
    data, data-plane error / 500 — verifies
    apiSpotCandlesValidates STILL passes
    distinguishing 400-path from data-plane bugs,
    response-shape regression / wrong key); 85/85
    pass (was 81). Now 30 invariants: 6 api-internal
    + 21 indexer (2 liveness + 6 data-aware coverage
    + 4 single-row data-shape + 2 multi-row data-shape
    + 2 cross-layer match + 4 cross-entity FK + 1
    cross-entity time-coherence) + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: api-side coverage now spans ALL
    three modes (validation, data-plane, cross-layer)
    — completes the api-internal arc. Next:
    candlesAggregation, conservation, probabilityBounds,
    chartShape.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (proposalEntityOrganizationReferentialIntegrity)**
  (previous iteration, on the api side) — closes the
  registry FK chain coverage:
  * `proposalEntityOrganizationReferentialIntegrity`
    — single GraphQL query reads `proposalEntities
    (first: 1) { id organization { id } } organizations
    (first: 50) { id }`; asserts
    `proposal.organization.id ∈ organizations`.

  - **All 4 documented FK relationships now covered**:
    * Pool ← Swap (swapPoolReferentialIntegrity)
    * Pool ← Candle (candlePoolReferentialIntegrity)
    * Aggregator ← Organization
      (organizationAggregatorReferentialIntegrity)
    * Organization ← ProposalEntity (THIS)

  - **Bug shapes caught (lower-link specific)**:
    proposal-event handler derives org id wrong (every
    new proposal becomes orphan if FK reads wrong
    topic slot); org deleted but proposals weren't
    GC'd (orphan proposals — distinct from orphan
    orgs because proposal sync may run independently
    of org sync); schema migration that renamed
    Organization without updating ProposalEntity FK.

  - **Symmetric FK build-out is now complete** within
    the indexer layer: candles indexer has 2 FK checks
    (covering both entity-emit paths); registry
    indexer has 2 FK checks (covering the full FK
    chain).

  - **Fixture extension**: each proposalEntity row now
    gets `organization: {id}` (default mock-org-0);
    new `proposalEntityOrganizationIds` array option
    for tests to override per-proposal FK.

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy with FK intact,
    vacuous-no-proposals, orphan proposal — verifies
    organizationAggregatorRefIntegrity STILL passes,
    distinguishing proposal-handler vs org-handler FK
    bugs, orphan-storm); 81/81 pass (was 77). Now 29
    invariants: 5 api-internal + 21 indexer (2
    liveness + 6 data-aware coverage + 4 single-row
    data-shape + 2 multi-row data-shape + 2 cross-layer
    match + 4 cross-entity FK + 1 cross-entity time-
    coherence) + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~99% (29 of ~30 sub-slices).
    Full FK chain coverage across both indexers
    closes a natural arc that started 4 iterations
    ago. Next arcs: candlesAggregation (sum
    reconciliation), conservation, probabilityBounds,
    chartShape — each exercises a different
    correctness dimension.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (organizationAggregatorReferentialIntegrity)**
  (previous iteration, on the api side) — cross-entity FK
  pattern now extends to the registry indexer:
  * `organizationAggregatorReferentialIntegrity` —
    single GraphQL query reads `organizations(first: 1)
    { id aggregator { id } } aggregators(first: 50)
    { id }`; asserts `org.aggregator.id ∈ aggregators`.

  - **Pins the upper link of the registry FK chain**:
    Aggregator ← Organization ← ProposalEntity. This
    invariant covers Organization → Aggregator. The
    remaining ProposalEntity → Organization link is
    next iteration (parallel pattern).

  - **Bug shapes caught**: org-event handler derives
    aggregator id wrong; aggregator deleted but
    organizations weren't garbage-collected; schema
    migration that renamed Aggregator without updating
    Organization.aggregator FK; handler dropped FK.

  - **Fixture extension**: each org row now gets
    `aggregator: {id}` (default mock-agg-0); new
    `organizationAggregatorIds` array for per-org FK
    override (mirrors swapPoolIds / candlePoolIds).

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy with FK intact,
    vacuous-no-orgs, orphan org from FK derivation
    bug — verifies existence checks STILL pass,
    distinguishing entity existence from relationship
    integrity, orphan-storm from all aggregators
    deleted); 77/77 pass (was 73). Now 28 invariants:
    5 api-internal + 20 indexer (2 liveness + 6
    data-aware coverage + 4 single-row data-shape +
    2 multi-row data-shape + 2 cross-layer match +
    3 cross-entity FK + 1 cross-entity time-coherence)
    + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~98% (28 of ~30 sub-slices).
    Three of four documented FK relationships covered
    (Swap→Pool, Candle→Pool, Organization→Aggregator);
    ProposalEntity→Organization remaining.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (candleSwapTimeWindowConsistency)**
  (previous iteration, on the api side) — first cross-
  entity TIME-COHERENCE check in the catalog:
  * `candleSwapTimeWindowConsistency` — single GraphQL
    query reads latest swap (orderBy timestamp desc)
    AND latest candle (orderBy time desc); asserts
    `latestSwap.timestamp ≥ latestCandle.time`.

  - **Why this is a real invariant**: candles
    aggregate swaps. A swap at time T causes a candle
    at floor(T/period)*period. So the latest candle's
    time should NEVER exceed the latest swap's
    timestamp. If it does, a candle exists for a
    period that has no contained swap — clock-skew,
    stale swap stream, or aggregator pulling time
    from a different source than swap-handler.

  - **Distinct from per-row time-shape probes**:
    swapTimestampSensible and candleTimeMonotonic
    validate each entity's time field on its own
    terms. This validates that the TWO entities' time
    fields are MUTUALLY consistent. Test 4
    demonstrates the distinction — failure mode
    (candle 1 day in future) leaves swapTimestampSensible
    passing because the swap timestamp is fine; only
    the cross-entity relationship is broken.

  - **Multi-entity-in-one-query pattern unlocks
    candlesAggregation**: this is the template the
    next quantitative invariant will reuse with sum
    reconciliation (∑ swap amounts in period =
    candle.volume). Query-shape (multiple collections
    in one POST), parsing (extract each from `data`),
    vacuous-handling (when either side empty) all
    generalize.

  - **Fixture default change**: `candleTimeAnchor`
    shifted from `now` to `now - 7200` (2h ago) so
    the new invariant passes naturally with default
    fixtures (latestSwapTimestamp default is `now -
    3600`). All other tests unaffected (relative
    comparisons preserved).

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy with default
    fixture, vacuous-no-swaps, vacuous-no-candles,
    failure with candle-in-future / swapTimestampSensible
    STILL passing); 73/73 pass (was 69). Now 27
    invariants: 5 api-internal + 19 indexer (2
    liveness + 6 data-aware coverage + 4 single-row
    data-shape + 2 multi-row data-shape + 2 cross-layer
    match + 2 cross-entity FK + 1 cross-entity time-
    coherence) + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~97% (27 of ~28 sub-slices).
    Cross-entity coverage now spans both REFERENTIAL
    (FK) and QUANTITATIVE (time-window) consistency.
    Next: candlesAggregation (sum-of-swaps =
    candle.volume), conservation, probabilityBounds.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (candlePoolReferentialIntegrity)**
  (previous iteration, on the api side) — candle analog of
  the iteration before's swapPoolReferentialIntegrity:
  * `candlePoolReferentialIntegrity` — single GraphQL
    query reads `candles(first: 1, ..., orderBy: time)
    { id pool { id } } pools(first: 50) { id }`;
    asserts `candle.pool.id ∈ Set(pools.map(p => p.id))`.

  - **Why TWO FK checks (swap + candle) vs one
    generic check**: the FK on swaps and the FK on
    candles are set by DIFFERENT code paths in the
    indexer:
    * Swap.pool: set by the swap-event handler, one
      derivation per Swap event
    * Candle.pool: set by the period-aggregator, one
      derivation per Candle bucket
    An indexer with correct swap-handler FK derivation
    but broken period-aggregator FK derivation passes
    swapPoolReferentialIntegrity and FAILS this one.
    The two together pin the FK contract on both
    entity-emit paths.

  - **Bug shapes caught (in addition to the swap-side
    ones)**:
    * Period-aggregator picks wrong pool when bucketing
      swaps (uses last-seen pool ref instead of each
      swap's own pool — would also light up
      candlesAggregation when that lands)
    * Pool deleted but candle aggregates weren't
      garbage-collected (orphan candles — distinct from
      orphan swaps because aggregators may emit
      independently of swap ingestion)
    * Aggregator handler returns null pool

  - **Fixture extension**: every candle row now gets
    `pool: {id}` field (default `mock-pool-0`); new
    `candlePoolIds` array option for tests to override
    per-candle FK and simulate orphan-candle scenarios
    (mirrors `swapPoolIds` from previous slice).

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy with FK intact,
    vacuous when 0 candles, orphan candle from
    aggregator FK bug — verifies SWAP FK STILL passes,
    distinguishing aggregator vs swap-handler FK bug,
    orphan-storm from all pools deleted); 69/69 pass
    (was 65). Now 26 invariants: 5 api-internal + 18
    indexer (2 liveness + 6 data-aware coverage + 4
    single-row data-shape + 2 multi-row data-shape +
    2 cross-layer match + 2 cross-entity FK) + 3
    chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~96% (26 of ~27 sub-slices).
    Symmetric build-out continues: cross-layer match
    has both candles + registry; cross-entity FK now
    has both swap + candle. Both entity-emit paths
    covered. Next: candlesAggregation (Candle.volume =
    sum of contained Swap amounts within period —
    combines THE FK we just verified with quantitative
    reconciliation).

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (swapPoolReferentialIntegrity)**
  (previous iteration, on the api side) — first cross-entity
  FK check in the catalog:
  * `swapPoolReferentialIntegrity` — single GraphQL
    query reads `swaps(first: 1, ...) { id pool { id } }
    pools(first: 50) { id }` in one round-trip; asserts
    `swap.pool.id ∈ Set(pools.map(p => p.id))`.

  - **Why FK integrity is its own failure class**:
    previous indexer probes were either single-entity
    (existence/data-shape) or cross-layer (api↔direct
    match). Both can pass while entities have BROKEN
    relationships:
    * candlesHasPools + candlesHasSwaps both pass →
      entities exist independently
    * apiCandlesMatchesDirect passes → api↔indexer
      agree on each entity, independently
    * BUT swap.pool.id can still point at nothing
    This is the first invariant that detects the
    relationship break.

  - **Bug shapes caught**: handler derives pool id
    wrong (wrong topic slot, mangled transform), pool
    deleted but swaps weren't garbage-collected
    (orphan rows), schema migration that renamed Pool
    without updating Swap.pool, handler dropped FK.

  - **Vacuous case nuance**: vacuous when SWAPS=0
    (no FK to check); DISTINCT from "pools=0 but
    swaps>0" — that's an integrity FAIL (every swap
    is orphan), not vacuous. Test 4 verifies this.

  - **Fixture extension**: every swap row gets
    `pool: {id}` field (default `mock-pool-0`); new
    `swapPoolIds` array option for tests to override
    per-swap and simulate orphan-swap bugs.

  - **Smoke tests**: 4 new (happy with FK intact,
    vacuous when 0 swaps, orphan from FK derivation
    bug — verifies existence checks STILL pass,
    distinguishing "entities exist independently"
    from "entities consistent with each other",
    orphan-storm from all pools deleted); 65/65 pass
    (was 61). Now 25 invariants: 5 api-internal + 17
    indexer (2 liveness + 6 data-aware coverage + 4
    single-row data-shape + 2 multi-row data-shape +
    2 cross-layer match + 1 cross-entity FK) + 3
    chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~95% (25 of ~27 sub-slices).
    New cross-entity pattern unlocks invariants the
    catalog didn't have before — relationships
    between entities, not just per-entity correctness.
    Next steps: candlesAggregation (Candle.volume =
    sum of contained Swap amounts within period —
    combines cross-entity FK with quantitative
    reconciliation), conservation (∑YES + ∑NO = ∑sDAI).

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (apiRegistryMatchesDirect)**
  (previous iteration, on the api side) — registry analog
  of the iteration before's apiCandlesMatchesDirect:
  * `apiRegistryMatchesDirect` — single GraphQL query
    touches all THREE registry entity types
    (proposalEntities + organizations + aggregators) in
    one round-trip, then per-entity length + per-entity
    pair-wise id check.

  - **Why a single 3-entity query (vs three single-entity
    invariants)**: per-entity-type cache granularity is
    a real failure mode — api may cache proposalEntities
    while keeping organizations fresh. Single multi-
    entity query catches the inconsistency in one probe
    AND attributes the failure to the SPECIFIC entity
    that drifted (error message names "organizations" or
    "aggregators[0].id" rather than "registry mismatch").

  - **Bug classes caught (in addition to the
    candles-side ones from previous iteration)**:
    * Per-entity cache granularity: api caches
      proposalEntities but not organizations (any subset
      combination). Wholesale-cache or wholesale-fresh
      passes; selective caching fails.
    * Adapter rewriting per-entity: a regression that
      only mutates aggregators (e.g., metadata
      transformer applied to wrong entity type) lights
      up specifically.
    * Whole-row swap: same length, different rows.
      Length-only check would miss this; pair-wise id
      check catches it.

  - **Fixture refactor**: extracted `buildRegistry()`
    alongside the buildPools / buildSwaps / buildCandles
    builders. /registry/graphql now returns full
    registry data by default (was just `{__typename}`);
    routed through new `apiRegistryDriftFn` hook for
    drift simulation. /registry-direct/graphql
    simplified to use the same builder. Existing
    apiCanReachRegistry invariant still passes (only
    checks `__typename === 'Query'`, which the richer
    response still includes).

  - **Smoke tests**: 5 new (happy match, all-empty
    vacuous, organizations length mismatch / per-entity
    drift, aggregator id rewrite / adapter mutation,
    proposalEntities WHOLE-row swap / same length but
    different rows); 61/61 pass (was 56). Now 24
    invariants: 5 api-internal + 16 indexer (2
    liveness + 6 data-aware coverage + 4 single-row
    data-shape + 2 multi-row data-shape + 2 cross-layer
    MATCH) + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~94% (24 of ~26 sub-slices). Both
    candles AND registry now have api↔direct match
    coverage (parity with existence + data-aware
    probes). Symmetric build-out continues — as candles
    got apiCandlesMatchesDirect last iteration,
    registry now gets the analog. Next natural moves
    are cross-entity invariants like candlesAggregation
    that combine multiple entity types from a single
    endpoint.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (apiCandlesMatchesDirect)**
  (previous iteration, on the api side) — first true
  api↔indexer MATCH check in the catalog:
  * `apiCandlesMatchesDirect` — issues the same GraphQL
    query against `apiUrl/candles/graphql` AND the
    direct `candlesUrl` IN PARALLEL, then compares
    lengths + ids + times pair-wise.

  - **Closes a gap no other invariant covers**: previous
    api↔* probes only assert "api can reach indexer"
    via __typename; previous candles* probes only assert
    "indexer has data". This is the first to assert
    they AGREE on the data — strictly stronger than
    either alone.

  - **Bug classes caught**:
    * api-side caching gone stale (api serves old
      snapshot while direct shows fresh data — every
      existing invariant passes, user sees wrong nums)
    * adapter rewriting (candles-adapter mutates output)
    * schema-mismatch (api expects schema X, indexer
      emits Y)
    * partial-rewrite (id matches but time drifted —
      caught by the secondary pair-wise time check)

  - **New pattern unlocks the rest of the cross-layer
    table**: PARALLEL queries to two endpoints + row-by-
    row compare. Future cross-layer invariants
    (apiRegistryMatchesDirect, candlesAggregation,
    chartShape) all reuse this template.

  - **Fixture refactor**: extracted shared
    buildPools / buildSwaps / buildCandles row builders
    so the api passthrough endpoint and the direct
    indexer endpoint return IDENTICAL data by default
    (modeling reality — api literally forwards). New
    `apiCandlesDriftFn` hook lets tests rewrite api-side
    response to simulate drift; default identity = no-op.

  - **Smoke tests**: 5 new (happy match, both-empty
    vacuous, length mismatch / cache stale, id drift /
    adapter rewrote, time drift / partial-rewrite);
    56/56 pass (was 51). Now 23 invariants: 5
    api-internal + 15 indexer (2 liveness + 6 data-aware
    coverage + 4 single-row data-shape + 2 multi-row
    data-shape + 1 cross-layer MATCH) + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~93% (23 of ~25 sub-slices).
    Cross-layer match pattern is now wired; the rest
    of the documented "Cross-layer invariants" table
    (candlesAggregation, chartShape, registry analog)
    becomes incremental work on top of this.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (candleTimeMonotonic +
  swapTimeMonotonicNonStrict)** (previous iteration, on
  the api side) — first MULTI-ROW data-shape invariants
  in the catalog. Previous data-shape probes all looked at
  a single row; these compare adjacent rows in a series:
  * `candleTimeMonotonic` — query last 5 candles ordered
    `time desc`, assert STRICTLY decreasing. Each candle
    covers a unique period; same `time` across two rows
    is a period-aggregator bug.
  * `swapTimeMonotonicNonStrict` — query last 5 swaps
    ordered `timestamp desc`, assert NON-STRICTLY
    decreasing. Multiple swaps per block legally share
    a block timestamp; the bug is going BACKWARDS.

  - **Strict-vs-non-strict encodes real semantics**:
    candles emit one row per period (strict by
    construction); swaps emit per-event (non-strict
    because block.ts is the source). A future change
    that lets candle aggregator emit duplicate rows OR
    that reorders swap events backwards lights up here.

  - **Bug classes caught (distinct from single-row
    probes)**:
    * Candles: period-aggregator upsert-as-insert,
      bucket-key off-by-one collisions, broken orderBy.
      Single-row OHLC/volume probes can't see these.
    * Swaps: orderBy returning insertion-order instead
      of timestamp; off-by-one wrong-block context on
      a swap. swapTimestampSensible is single-row range;
      this is cross-row drift inside that range.

  - **Multi-row pattern unlocks future cross-row
    invariants**: TWAP-window monotonicity (PR #54
    shape from the invariants table), conservation
    sums, candlesAggregation. This slice establishes
    the access pattern (`first: 5, orderBy: X,
    orderDirection: desc` + iterate adjacent pairs).

  - **Fixture extension**: 4 new options
    (`candleTimes`, `candleTimeStep`, `swapTimestamps`,
    `swapTimestampStep`). Every row now gets a `time`/
    `timestamp` field (auto-generated descending series
    OR explicit array for failure-mode tests). Defaults
    keep the existing single-row tests green via the
    "vacuous when count < 2" escape.

  - **Smoke tests**: 6 new (candle happy/vacuous/
    duplicate/out-of-order, swap happy with same-block
    timestamps, swap backwards-bug); 51/51 pass (was 45).
    Now 22 invariants: 5 api-internal + 14 indexer (2
    liveness + 6 data-aware coverage + 4 single-row
    data-shape + 2 multi-row data-shape) + 3 chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~92% (22 of ~24 sub-slices). First
    multi-row pattern in the catalog opens the door to
    true cross-row invariants in upcoming slices.

- **slice 4d-scenarios-more (swapAmountsPositive +
  swapTimestampSensible)** (previous iteration, on the api
  side) — extends data-shape pattern from Candle to Swap:
  * `swapAmountsPositive` — amountIn > 0 AND amountOut > 0
  * `swapTimestampSensible` — timestamp ∈ [2020-01-01,
    now + 1 day]

  - **Bug classes caught**:
    * Amounts: Algebra Swap event has SIGNED amount0/1
      (from-token negative). Indexer must Math.abs() into
      unsigned amountIn/Out. If handler assigns signed
      directly, one is ≤ 0. Distinct from candle-volume
      aggregator bug (per-swap event-decoder bug).
    * Timestamp: indexer reads from block context. Wrong
      topic slot (off-by-one decoder) → 0 or garbage from
      hash slot.

  - **Vacuously true when no swaps**: same pattern as
    candle-shape probes.

  - **Fixture extension**: 3 new options
    (latestSwapAmountIn/AmountOut/Timestamp); first swap
    in response carries the field values.

  - **Smoke tests**: 6 new (happy + various failure modes,
    including a far-future-timestamp test for the garbage-
    from-wrong-topic-slot case); 45/45 pass (was 39).
    Now 20 invariants: 5 api-internal + 12 indexer (2
    liveness + 6 data-aware coverage + 4 data-shape) + 3
    chain-layer.

  - Slice 4 progress: ~91% (21 of ~23 sub-slices).
    Both Candle and Swap entities have data-shape coverage
    (2 invariants each). Pool entity could get the same
    treatment but indexer produces minimal Pool data so
    value-add is lower.
