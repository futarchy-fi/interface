// Phase 0 acceptance gate (CHECKLIST item 41): "Sister-link verified:
// a fresh checkout of both repos in `~/code/futarchy-fi/` runs
// docker compose config cleanly". The doc-side equivalent is
// keeping ARCHITECTURE.md in lockstep — Phase 0 explicitly required
// `diff` to report identical across both repos.
//
// This test puts the diff on autopilot for any contributor with the
// sibling-clone layout (api + interface as siblings under the same
// parent dir, which is the layout `~/code/futarchy-fi/` recommends).
//
// **Skip behavior**: if the sibling repo isn't checked out at the
// expected sibling path, the test SKIPS rather than fails. CI
// runners and one-repo clones won't see the sister; that's fine —
// the workflow-level cross-repo drift check (a future slice) will
// own that case.
//
// Sister test on the api side mirrors this one in reverse (looks
// up the interface-side ARCHITECTURE.md). Both pass on a single
// pinned baseline; either failing means the shared spec drifted.
